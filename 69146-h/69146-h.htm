<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“O-O-OH! oh me-e!” Dick made the sigh
very sad and pitiful.</p>

<p>His father did not seem to hear it.
He tilted his chair farther back, perched his feet
on the porch railing, and unfolded his newspaper.</p>

<p>It was a mild April morning, and the Osborne
family had drifted out on the porch,—Mr. Osborne
with his papers and Mrs. Osborne with her
sewing; Sweet William was playing jackstraws
with himself, Patsy sat on the steps with her
back to the others, especially Dick, who, however,
was pitying himself too much to notice her.</p>

<p>“I always get blamed for everything I do,”
he said mournfully, “but David——”</p>

<p>“‘House for War: Vote 373 to 50.’” Mr.
Osborne read the headline. “That is the answer
to the President’s message four days ago. Now
the Senate——”</p>

<p>“Father! If you’ll just let me off to-day, I’ll
work from school-out till dark every day next
week. I certainly will. Father, please——”</p>

<p>“Richard Randolph Osborne! You are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
work your assigned part of the garden to-day, <i>to-day</i>,
without further pleas for postponement.”
Mr. Osborne’s mild voice and red flabby face
stiffened with determination. This was not the
first week that Dick had neglected his garden
task.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Dick answered meekly, wriggling
a little. That was all he could do—wriggle a
little—because he was made into a sort of merman
by having an old Persian shawl wrapped
about him, from the waist down. “I think you
might let me off,” he persisted in an undertone;
“just this one more time. If mother had patched
my trousers last night—if she’d let me put on my
Sundays now—I could get that hateful old garden
worked this morning. I’ve got something
else to do to-day, something awfully important.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I forgot, son,” said his mother. “I
certainly meant to mend them last night. I was
reading, and forgot. I wish you had reminded
me.” She took quicker stitches and her thread
snarled so that she had to break it and begin
again. “I am so sorry,” she repeated in the delicious
voice that made her words seem as fresh
and sweet as the red roses that fell from the
mouth of the fairy-tale maiden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne was a dear, sunny-hearted little
woman with dark hair, irregular features, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
vivid, eager face. She loved to read; indeed, she
could no more resist a book than a toper could
refuse a drink, but she was always so sorry and
so ashamed when she neglected home duties that
every one except the person who suffered from it
forgave her freely.</p>

<p>Patsy, Dick’s twin sister, came now to her
mother’s defense. “It’s your fault, Dick,” she
said. “It’s all your own fault. If you had locked
the bookcase door, it would have reminded her
there was something to do. And then she would
have thought of the trousers.”</p>

<p>“I forgot,” Dick confessed. That put him
clearly in the wrong, and made him the crosser.
He turned on his sister, growling: “What business
is it of yours, miss? You please let my
affairs alone and attend to your own. What are
you doing, Patsy?”</p>

<p>He tried to wriggle near enough to see, but
Patsy made a face at him and ran into the yard.
Dick was such a tease! She was not going to tell
him that she had decided to be a poet and was
composing a wonderful ballad. How surprised
he would be when it came out in the <i>Atlantic</i> or
<i>St. Nicholas</i>, with her name in big black letters—Pocahontas
Virginia Osborne, as it was in the
family Bible. Or would she have a pen-name,
like ‘Marion Harland’? If she could think of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
lovely original name—— But perhaps she had
better finish the poem first.</p>

<p>She perched herself in the swing and chewed
her pencil and read over the four lines she had
written:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Johnny was a sailor,</div>
<div class="indent">He was brave and bold;</div>
<div class="verse">He thought he would make an adventure</div>
<div class="indent">To find the North Pole.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She could not think of anything else to say, so
she read that over again; and then again. While
inspiration tarried, an interruption came. It
took the shape of her small brother William with
two of his followers—Hop-o-hop, a lame duck
that he had adopted when its hen mother pecked
it and cast it off, and Scalawag, a sand-colored,
bob-tailed stray dog that had adopted him.</p>

<p>“Hey, Patsy! I think I’ll give you a kiss,”
announced Sweet William, raising his fair, serious
face to hers. “I think I might give you two
kisses. You are so sweet. Patsy,” he went on
coaxingly, “wouldn’t you want to lend me a pencil?
Just one little minute, to make you a picture
of a horse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sweet William, you’re such a nuisance!”
said Patsy. “I’m awfully busy. How can I ever
finish this, if you bother me?”</p>

<p>But she gave him pencil and paper, and sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
swinging back and forth, looking idly about the
spacious yard where the budding oaks made
lacelike shadows, on that April morning.</p>

<p>In the center of the yard was a great heap of
bricks. That was the remains of Osborne’s Rest,
the family mansion that had been burned in a raid
during The War, as those southern Virginians
called the War of Secession from which they
dated everything. Since then, two generations
of Osbornes had dwelt in The Roost, a cottage
in one corner of the yard. It was now the home
of Patsy, her father and mother, her two
brothers, Dick and Sweet William, and a motherless
cousin, David Spotswood.</p>

<p>The big front gate opened on The Street, the
one thoroughfare of The Village. There were a
church, a tavern, two shops, a dozen frame and
brick dwellings set far back in spacious grounds,
and the county Court-house in a square by itself.
Behind the Court-house rambled The Back Way
which had once expected to become a street, but
remained always The Back Way with only a
blacksmith’s shop, a basket-maker’s shed, and a
few cabins on it.</p>

<p>A century and a half before, three royal-grant
estates, Broad Acres and Larkland and Mattoax,
cornered at a stone now on Court-house Green.
These plantations had long ago been divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
small farms; but in The Village still lived Wilsons
and Mayos and Osbornes who counted as
outsiders all whose grandfathers were not born
in the neighborhood and the kinship.</p>

<p>While we have been looking about, Sweet William
lay flat on the ground, holding his tongue
between his teeth, to assist his artistic efforts.</p>

<p>“Look at my horse, Patsy!” he crowed, holding
up the paper.</p>

<p>“Hm-m! I don’t call that much like a horse,”
observed Patsy.</p>

<p>Sweet William’s face clouded, and then brightened.
“Tell you what!” he said. “It’ll be a cow.
I’ll kick out one hind leg and put a bucket here.
Now! She’s spilt all the milk.”</p>

<p>Patsy laughed; and then one knew that she
was pretty, seeing the merry crinkles around her
twinkling hazel eyes, and the upward curve of
her lips that brought out dimples on her freckled
pink cheeks.</p>

<p>“I love you when you laugh, Patsy!” exclaimed
Sweet William, hugging her knees. “You
may have my picture. And I’ll sit in the swing
with you.”</p>

<p>“You and Scalawag and Hop-o-hop may have
the swing,” said Patsy. “I’m going in. I’ll finish
my poem to-morrow. I want to find out—I think
Dick has a secret.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>She jumped out of the swing, gave Sweet William’s
ear a “love pinch,” and strolled back to the
porch.</p>

<p>“Dick,” she asked in an offhand way, “what
are you going to do with that candle you got this
morning?”</p>

<p>Dick’s gloom relaxed and he winked tantalizingly.</p>

<p>“You wish you knew,” he said. “But—you’ll—never—find—out.
Ah, ha-a-a!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you tell, Mister Dick!” said Patsy. “I
don’t want you to tell. I’d rather find out for
myself. And I certainly will find out, sir. You
just see if I don’t.”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne still had his nose in his day-old
paper; news younger than that seldom, came to
The Village. “‘Army plans call for a million
men the first year.’ That is a gigantic undertaking,
Miranda, and—”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” she agreed placidly. “Mayo,
Black Mayo has bought some more pigeons; and
Polly says he’ll not tell what he paid for them, so
she knows it’s some absurd sum that he can’t
afford.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Her husband agreed absently. “And
a million men means not only men, but arms,
equipment, food. Bless my life! Is that clock
striking—it can’t be!—is it ten? And I here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
instead of at the Court-house.” He got up and
stuffed the newspaper and a <i>Congressional Record</i>
in his pocket.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, dear?” asked his
wife.</p>

<p>“We want to find out if the Board of Supervisors
can appropriate money to send our Confederate
veterans to the Reunion in June. There
have been so many unusual expenses, bridges
washed away and that smallpox quarantine, that
funds are low. I hope they can raise the requisite
amount.”</p>

<p>“Of course they will. They must,” Mrs.
Osborne said quickly and positively. “Why,
the yearly reunion—seeing old comrades, being
heroized, recalling the glorious past—is
the one bright spot in their gray old
lives.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Tavis and Cap’n Anderson were talking
about the Reunion at the post office yesterday,”
said Dick. “They are just crazy about having
it in Washington. Cap’n has never been there.
But he was telling how near he and old Jube
Early came to it, in ’64.”</p>

<p>“What an experience it will be, taking peaceful
possession in old age of the Capital they campaigned
against when they were soldier boys,
over fifty years ago!” said Mrs. Osborne. “Certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
they must go. How many are there,
Mayo?”</p>

<p>“Nine in our district,” answered her husband.
“Last year there were sixteen. Three have died,
and four are bedridden.”</p>

<p>“Ah! so few are left; so many have passed on.”
Mrs. Osborne glanced through the open door at
a portrait, her father in a colonel’s gray uniform.
“Of course they must go, our nine old
soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Dick. “If there isn’t money
enough, we boys can help raise it. Mr. Tavis
says he’ll pay me to plant corn, afternoons and
Saturdays. I wasn’t thinking about doing it.
But our old Confeds mustn’t miss their Reunion.”</p>

<p>“Good boy! that’s the right spirit,” exclaimed
Mrs. Osborne.</p>

<p>She adored the memory of her gallant father
and of the Confederate cause to which he had devoted
himself. The quiet, uneventful years had
brought no new deep, inspiring interests to the
little Southern community. Its love and loyalty
clung to the past. To the children the Lost Cause
was a tradition as heroic and romantic as the
legends of Roland and Arthur; but it was a tradition
linked to reality by the old gray-clad men
who had fought with Lee and Jackson. As Jones
and Tavis and Walthall, they were ordinary old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
men, rather tiresome and absurd; but call them
“Confederate veterans” and they were transformed
to heroes whom it was an honor to serve.
Dick, shirking the work that meant food for
his family, would toil gladly to send them to their
Reunion.</p>

<p>“They must have this, perhaps their last—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne paused, and her husband said:
“We’ll manage it; we’ll manage it somehow. If
there is a deficit, we may be able to make it up
by private subscription. Perhaps I’ll get a case
next term of court, and can make a liberal contribution.”
He laughed.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne—called Red Mayo to distinguish
him from a dark-haired cousin of the same name,
called Black Mayo—was a lawyer more by profession
than by practice; there were not enough
law crumbs in The Village, he said, to support a
sparrow.</p>

<p>He strolled toward the Court-house while Mrs.
Osborne took her last hurried stitches. Then she
handed the patched trousers to her son, who rolled
indoors and put them on. He went into the
garden and gloomily eyed the neglected square
where peas and potatoes and onions were merely
green lines among crowding weeds.</p>

<p>“I certainly can’t finish it this morning,” he
growled. “There’s too much to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“If you work hard, you can finish by sundown,”
said his cousin, David Spotswood, who
was planting a row of beets on the other side of
the garden.</p>

<p>“I can’t work after dinner,” said Dick. “I’ve
got something else to do. I just can’t finish it
to-day.”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” said Patsy, who had followed
him into the garden. “When father says ‘Richard’
and shuts his mouth—so! he means business.
Say, Dick! What were you getting that
candle for? What are you going to do? Let us
go with you, Anne Lewis and me, and I’ll help
you here.”</p>

<p>“You help!” Dick spoke in his most superior
masculine manner. “Girls haven’t any business
in gardens. They ought to stay in the house and
make bed-quilts. They’re too afraid of dirty
hands and freckled faces.”</p>

<p>Patsy flared up and answered so quickly that
her words stepped on one another’s heels.
“That’s mean and unfair! You know I hate
gloves and bonnets, and I just wear them because
mother makes me. But anyway, sir, I think
they’re nicer than great-grandmother’s shawl for
trousers.”</p>

<p>She went back up the boxwood-bordered
walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>“I’ll keep my eyes on you, Mr. Richard Randolph
Osborne,” she said to herself. “Where
you go to-day, I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>Halfway up the long walk, she came upon
Sweet William, sitting on the ground, holding a
maple bough over his head.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come to our picnic, Patsy?”
he said. “Me and Scalawag are having a
loverly picnic in the woods down by Tinkling
Water.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Patsy. “I want to see
Anne Lewis about going somewhere after dinner.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Sweet William.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—till I find out,” laughed Patsy.
“But Anne and I will do that; we certainly will.”</p>

<p>“I wish Anne was staying here,” Sweet William
said wistfully.</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Patsy. “Easter holiday is
too short to divide with Ruth. Oh! I’ll be so glad
when it’s summer and Anne comes to stay a long
time.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t ever a long time where Anne is,” said
Sweet William. “I’m going with you to see
her, Patsy, and I’ll have my picnic another
day.”</p>

<p>They went off and left Dick raking and weeding
and hoeing very diligently; but, working his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
best, he had not half finished his task when the
dinner bell rang. He surveyed the garden with
a scowl.</p>

<p>“It’ll take hours and hours to get it done,” he
said. “And then it would be too late to go where
I’m going. Maybe I can work the potato patch
after supper.”</p>

<p>“You can’t,” said David, who had a straightforward
way of facing facts.</p>

<p>“Oh! maybe I can,” said Dick, who had a picturesque
way of evading them. “You might
help me. You might work on it awhile after
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Thank you! I’ve something else to do. I’m
going to harrow my corn acre. I want to plant
it next week,” said David, who was a blue-ribbon
member of the Boys’ Corn Club.</p>

<p>At the dinner table the boys were joined by
Sweet William, Patsy, and Anne Lewis, a cousin
who was spending her Easter holiday in The Village.
The two girls watched Dick like hawks,
and jumped up from the table as soon as he went
out of the dining room. He hurried to the little
upstairs room he shared with David that was
called the “tumble-up room” because the steps
were so steep. Presently he came down and
showed off the things he was putting in his
pockets—a candle, a box of matches, and a ball of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
stout twine. He sharpened his hatchet and fastened
it to his belt.</p>

<p>“Yah! You wish you knew what that’s for,”
he said, with a derisive face at Patsy and then at
Anne.</p>

<p>He strutted across the yard toward the front
gate, but he was not to march off in undisturbed
triumph.</p>

<p>“Dick! uh Dick!” called his mother. “Remember
you’ve your garden work to finish.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.” He scowled, then he said doggedly:
“There’s something else I’ve promised myself
to do first.”</p>

<p>Anne and Patsy waited only to see that he
turned up, not down, The Street; then they
ran around The Back Way and came out just
behind him at the church; there The Street
turned to a road which led past the mill and
on to Redville. Dick walked quickly, and the
girls hurried after him; then he walked slowly,
and they loitered so as to keep just behind
him.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” he turned and challenged
them.</p>

<p>“Oh! we might go to the mill to see Cousin
Giles, or to Larkland to look at Cousin Mayo’s
new pigeons, or to Happy Acres,” answered
Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Dick strode on, and the girls trotted behind
him, making amicable efforts at conversation.</p>

<p>“Steve Tavis has gone fishing with John and
Baldie Eppes,” Anne remarked. “He said we
girls might go, too. But Patsy and I thought
there might be something—something more fun
to do.”</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Patsy made an effort. “Dick,” she said, “I
hope you’ll finish your garden work to-day.
Father’s tired of excuses and he’s made up his
mind for punishing. But even if we do get home
late, I can help you.”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty nice day,” Patsy went on pleadingly,
“to—to do outdoor things. You say yourself
I’m as good as a boy to have around. I
wouldn’t be in the way at all; and I could hold
the candle for you.”</p>

<p>By this time they were at the mill where the
Larkland road and the Happy Acres path turned
from the highway. Dick kept to the main road
and the girls followed. He stopped and faced
them.</p>

<p>“You said you were going to the mill, or Larkland,
or Happy Acres. Trot along!”</p>

<p>“I said we might go there,” Patsy amended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
“Or we might go—’most anywhere. Do let us
go with you; please, Dick.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Oh! wherever you are going. We’ll not tell.”</p>

<p>“You certainly will not,” he declared; “for a
mighty good reason: you are not going to know
anything to tell.”</p>

<p>Patsy’s eyes flashed. “We’ll show you,” she
said. “We are going to follow you, like your
shadow. You know good and well I can run as
fast as you. Now take your choice, sir; let us
go with you, or give up and toddle home and
finish your task so as not to get punished.”</p>

<p>“Hm!” he jeered. “If I’ve got something on
hand good enough to take punishment for, it’s
too good to spoil with girls tagging along.”</p>

<p>He walked briskly up the road. Anne and
Patsy followed him for a silent mile—up and
down hills scarred with red gulleys, through
woods, by brown plowed fields and green grain
land. They passed several log cabins; the Spencer
place, an old mansion amid tumbled-down out-buildings;
Gordan Jones’s trim new house gay
with gables and fresh paint. Then they came to
an old farmhouse surrounded by neglected fields.</p>

<p>“Why, that door’s open!” Anne remarked with
surprise. “Is somebody living at the old Tolliver
place?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“A new man; Mr. Smith. He came here last
winter,” explained Patsy.</p>

<p>“Somebody new in the neighborhood!” laughed
Anne. “Doesn’t that seem queer? What sort
of folks are they?”</p>

<p>“Um-mm; unfolksy,” said Patsy. “There’s
just Mr. Smith, and his nephew Albert that goes
to our school. We’ve never got acquainted with
Albert. He’s sort of stand-offish; not as if he
wanted to be, but as if he were afraid.”</p>

<p>“Afraid of what?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know. Nothing. I reckon he’s
just shy.”</p>

<p>“What sort of man is Mr. Smith?” inquired
Anne.</p>

<p>“Ugly; and grins. He’s away from home most
of the time. He’s a salesman or agent of some
kind. Dick,” Patsy returned to a more interesting
subject, “do please tell us what you are going
to do.”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” Dick began as if he were about to
yield reluctantly; then he interrupted himself
eagerly: “Oh! look at that squirrel!”</p>

<p>Their eyes followed his pointing finger, and
crying, “Easy marks!” he darted into a dense
thicket of pines on the other side of the road.
The girls followed quickly, but he made good use
of his moment’s start and they caught only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
glimpses of him here and there behind the trees.</p>

<p>“Run, Anne!” Patsy called presently. “To the
left. Here! Let’s head him off!”</p>

<p>They ran around a thick clump of pines to
meet him—and he was not there. He did not
seem to be anywhere. He had vanished as completely
as if the earth had opened and swallowed
him.</p>

<p>“We may as well give up,” Anne sighed at
last.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Patsy agreed reluctantly. “I reckon
he’s miles away by this time.”</p>

<p>Crestfallen and disappointed, they went back
to the road and started slowly down the hill.</p>

<p>Then a red-brown head rose out of a heap of
pine brush, so cautiously that it did not disturb
the woodpecker drumming on a nearby stump. A
pair of merry brown eyes watched the girls till
they were at a safe distance; then Dick, to the
terror and hasty flight of the woodpecker,
scrambled out of the brush heap.</p>

<p>“Cock-a-doodle-doo-<i>oo-oo</i>!” he called deridingly.</p>

<p>Anne and Patsy started and looked back.</p>

<p>“There he is!” groaned Patsy.</p>

<p>Yes, there he was, standing in the middle of
the road, waving his hand tauntingly.</p>

<p>“Shall we chase him again?” asked Anne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Yes,” said Patsy; and then: “No, it’s no use.
He’s too far away; before we could get halfway
up the hill, he’d be out of sight again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” laughed Anne. “We don’t care,
Patsy-pet. Let’s go to Happy Acres and see
what flowers are in bloom.”</p>

<p>They went back to Larkland mill that had been
a mill ever since The Village had been a village;
crossed a foot bridge over Tinkling Water; and
followed the path to the woodland nook they
called Happy Acres. Long ago a house had been
there, and persistent garden bulbs and shrubs
gave beauty and fragrance to the place. One
spring, Anne had adopted it and christened it
Happy Acres, and she and her friends had made
it a little woodland park that was a joy to all the
neighborhood. It was fragrant now with a
blossoming plum-tree and gay with the pink and
scarlet of flowering almond and japonica.</p>

<p>Anne and Patsy plucked a few sprays to carry
home the beauty of it, and started down the path
for a little visit to their cousin, Giles Spotswood,
the miller.</p>

<p>Patsy, who was in front, stopped suddenly.
“What’s that?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“It sounds like men quarreling,” Anne whispered
back. “Who on earth—”</p>

<p>“Look there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Anne crept to Patsy’s side and peeped through
the bushes. There were two men on the roadside.
One was their cousin, Black Mayo Osborne.</p>

<p>“Who’s that man?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“Mr. Smith; the new man at the Tolliver
place.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! he’s horrid! snarling like a spiteful cur
dog!” exclaimed Anne.</p>

<p>The stranger was indeed odd and unpleasant-looking.
He had long loose-jointed limbs and
such a short body that it seemed as if its only
function was to hold his head and limbs together.
The two sides of his blond face were quite unlike.
The left side was handsome with its straight
brow and wide blue eye; but the right eye, half
hidden by its drooping lid, slanted outward and
down, the tip of the nose turned toward the bulging
right nostril, and the mouth drooped at the
right corner and ended in a heavy downward
line.</p>

<p>“Easy! go easy, my German friend!” Black
Mayo’s voice rang out clear and mocking.</p>

<p>“I am not a German; that am I not!” screamed
Smith. “I am an American citizen. I can my
papers show. I am more American than you.
What are your peoples here? <i>Ach!</i> what do they?
This morning they did the last cent out of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
treasury take, the expenses of old traitors and
rebels to pay—”</p>

<p>The sentence was not finished. A quick blow
from the shoulder stretched him on the ground.</p>

<p>“Hey! lie there a minute!” cried Black Mayo,
with an impish light twinkling in his dark eyes.
“Listen! Here’s a tune you’ve got to respect in
this part of the world.” He whistled “Dixie”
with vim and vigor, over and over again. Then
he stepped aside and held out his hand, saying:
“Ah, well! You didn’t know any better. Forget
it!”</p>

<p>The man glared up at him, without a word.</p>

<p>“Oh! if that’s the way you feel about it—”
Mr. Osborne laughed, shrugged his shoulders,
and, still whistling “Dixie,” took the road that
led to his home at Larkland.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith scrambled to his feet and looked
after Black Mayo, from under down-drawn
brows, with his thin wide lips writhing like serpents;
then he went limping up the road.</p>

<p>The girls turned white amazed faces to each
other.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” said Patsy. “Let’s go home. Do—do
you reckon he’ll hurt Cousin Mayo?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. He can’t. How can he?”
said Anne. After a pause she added: “He certainly
will if he can.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EXULTING at the way he had diddled
the girls, Dick pranced along the Redville
road. He did not meet any one, for
it was a fair spring day and the country people
were busy; but he saw men and boys he knew,
plowing and grubbing, hallooing to their teams
and to one another.</p>

<p>About two miles from The Village, Dick
turned off on the Old Plank Road. Twenty years
before, this had been a highway going through
The Village, on its long way to Richmond. Then
the railroad was built. It wanted to come through
The Village, between court-house and church,
but the people rose up in arms. They did not
want shrieking, grinding trains, to scare horses
and bring in outsiders, nor an iron track parting
their homes from their graves in the churchyard.
So the railroad went by Redville that was six
miles from The Village in summer and three or
four times as far in the winter season of ruts
and red mud.</p>

<p>After the railway was built, however, the road
by Redville station became the thoroughfare;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the Old Plank Road was seldom traveled except
by negroes who lived in clearings in the Big
Woods that covered miles of the rocky, infertile
ridge land.</p>

<p>Dick was near one of these clearings, a patch
of stumpy land around a log cabin, when he heard
a voice calling loudly, “Whoa! Gee! Whoa, I
say!”</p>

<p>An old negro was coming up the hill, in a cart
drawn by bony, long-horned oxen.</p>

<p>“Hey, Unc’ Isham!” said Dick. “What are
you making such a racket for?”</p>

<p>Isham Baskerfield jumped nervously; but when
he recognized the speaker, he grinned and said:
“Howdy, little marster! howdy! I was jest
talkin’ to my oxes. I tuk ’em down to de creek
to gin ’em some water.”</p>

<p>“You sounded scared,” commented Dick.
“And you looked scared, too.”</p>

<p>“Skeered? Course I aint skeered. Huccome
I be skeered?” Isham replied loudly. Then he
mumbled: “I aint nuver liked to go down dis
road since dat old man—Whar you gwine, Marse
Dick?” he interrupted himself. “Don’t you fool
’round dat lowermos’ cabin. Dat’s”—he
breathed the name in a whisper—“Solomon
Gabe’s house, dat is. An’ he can shore cunjer
folks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Dick laughed. “So that’s what you are afraid
of. You—”</p>

<p>“Sh—sh, little marster!” The old negro looked
around, as if afraid of being overheard. He
stopped his oxcart in front of his cabin. “I got
to git my meal bag,” he said. “Lily Belle emptied
it to make a hoecake for dinner, so I got to
go to mill an’ git some corn ground ’fore supper
time. I don’t worry ’bout nothin’ long as my
meal bag can stan’ up for itself, but when it lays
down I got to stir about. What you doin’,
Marse Dick, strayin’ so fur from home?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m just strolling ’round,” Dick answered
vaguely.</p>

<p>“Umph! When I fust see you, I thought you
mought be gwine fishin’; but you aint got no
fishin’ pole.”</p>

<p>“No use to carry a pole in the woods, when
you’ve got a knife,” said Dick. “Where is a good
place to go?”</p>

<p>“Uh! any o’ dem holes in Mine Creek below
de ford,” said the old man; “taint good fishin’
’bove thar.”</p>

<p>“O. K.!” said Dick. “If I catch more fish than
I can carry, I’ll leave you what I can’t tote home.”</p>

<p>“Yas, suh; yas, suh! I reckon you will,”
chuckled the old negro.</p>

<p>Dick went on down the road. But his merry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
whistle died on his lips as he passed Solomon
Gabe’s cabin.</p>

<p>It stood, like a dark, poisonous fungus, under
low-branching evergreens in a dank, somber hollow
a little away from the road. The squat old
log hovel had not even a window; the door stood
open, not hospitably, but like the yawning mouth
of a pit.</p>

<p>Dick ran on down the road and came presently
to Mine Creek, a little stream straggling
along a rocky, weed-fringed bed. Near the ford,
there was a pile of rotting logs and fallen stones
that had once been a cabin. He left the road
here, but he did not take Isham’s advice and go
down Mine Creek. Instead, he went up stream,
following a vague old path that presently crossed
the creek and climbed a little hill. There was a
small enclosure fenced in with rotting rails. In
and around the enclosure were piles of earth
and broken stones of such ancient date that saplings
and even trees were growing on them.</p>

<p>Dick paused on the hilltop and looked around
cautiously. No one was in sight; and all was still
except for the chatter of squirrels and the drumming
of woodpeckers. He jumped over the old
fence and advanced to the edge of a well-like
opening. Again he stopped and looked around.
Then he took out of his pocket a ball of string.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
He tied a stone to one end of it; dropped the stone
into the hole; played out his line until it rested
on the bottom; and tied a knot in the string at the
ground level.</p>

<p>Then he went into the woods and cut down a
hickory sapling; he measured it with his line and
cut it off at the top; and trimmed the branches,
leaving stout prongs at intervals of about
eighteen inches. Every now and then, he stopped
and looked about, to make sure that he was not
observed. After nearly an hour’s work, he
finished an improvised ladder which he carried
to the hole and slid over the edge. Then with a
final sharp lookout, he descended.</p>

<p>He found himself in a pit about ten feet in diameter,
heaped knee-deep with twigs and leaves
swept there by winds of many winters. At one
side there was an opening four feet wide and
five or six feet high, the mouth of a tunnel that
was roofed with logs supported on the sides by
stout rough timbers.</p>

<p>Dick lighted his candle and started down this
tunnel. But after a few steps he turned back, set
down his candle, and pulled his ladder into the
hole.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said. “Anybody’s welcome to
look in here. I reckon they’ll not find little
Dick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>He picked up his candle and went along the
tunnel. Now and then it dropped down abruptly,
but there were timbers and old ladders that made
the way passable. At last the tunnel broadened
into a room about thirty feet square and high
enough to stand upright in. This room also was
roofed with logs and poles propped by stout timbers
of white oak. Here and there were heaps of
earth and stones and piles of rotting timbers;
on the left side there was another tunnel.</p>

<p>Dick hesitated a minute, then he muttered:
“I reckon I’ll find <i>it</i> here. But I’ll look around
first.”</p>

<p>He followed the lower tunnel. It, too, slanted
downward, but it was longer than the upper one
and had several short spurs. It ended in a pit a
dozen feet deep, that had an old ladder in it.
Dick climbed down and looked around, then he
went back to the main room and began examining
the clay and stone between the supporting
timbers.</p>

<p>“It certainly seems as if they would have left
some,” he said earnestly to himself. “I ought to
see little bits sparkling somewhere. If they were
ever so little, they would show me where to
work.”</p>

<p>His tour of investigation brought him at last
to a corner where there was a heap of earth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
stones. He scrambled on top of the mound,—and,
in a twinkling, he landed at the bottom of a
hole.</p>

<p>For a minute he was stunned. Then he
staggered to his feet, lighted the candle which
had been extinguished in his fall, and looked
around. He had fallen into a pit ten or twelve
feet deep—probably an opening of the mine that
had been abandoned with the failure of a vein
that was being followed. The place had been
covered with a layer of logs and poles on top of
which earth and stones had been thrown. The
rotting timbers—how many years they had been
there!—had given way under his weight.</p>

<p>How was he to get out? The walls of the pit,
stone in one place and clay on the other sides,
were steep, almost perpendicular.</p>

<p>After considering awhile, he set his candle on
a projecting rock, took out his knife, and dug
some crannies for finger-holds and toe-holds, to
serve as a ladder. But when he put his weight
in them and tried to climb up, the clay
slipped under his feet and he slid back. He made
the holes larger and deeper, but after he mounted
two or three steps he slid back again; and again;
and again. At last he gave up this plan. Anyway,
if he could climb to the top, how could he
get out? He had crashed through the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the pit, and the broken downward-slanting poles
barred the sides.</p>

<p>Must he stay here and wait for help to come?
Help? What help? No one knew where he was.
Oh! how he regretted now his careful plans to
put every one off the trail. Anne and Patsy could
only say that they had last seen him on the main
road to Redville. And Isham thought he had
gone down Mine Creek.</p>

<p>If only he had left the ladder in place, there
would be a chance that when they missed him
and made search, they would look in the mine.
But he had taken that chance away from himself
by pulling the ladder into the pit.</p>

<p>He must dig his way out. He <i>must</i>! There
was no other way of escape. He selected a place
that seemed free from rocks, and began to hack
at the wall. He toiled till his arms ached and
his hands were sore and blistered. It was a slow
and painful task, but he was making progress.
He piled up loose rocks and stood on tiptoe, so
as to reach higher on the wall. In spite of his
weariness and his tormented hands, his spirits
rose.</p>

<p>“A tight place like this is lots of fun—after
you get out. Won’t Dave and Steve pop their
eyes when I tell ’em about it?”</p>

<p>He laughed and, with renewed vigor, drove his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
knife into the hard clay. There was a sharp
scratch and a snap. Something fell, click! on a
stone. It was his knife blade, broken against a
rock that extended shelf-like above him, and
formed an impassable barrier. All these hours of
work and pain were wasted. He must begin
again and dig out in another place; or try to,
and perhaps run against rock again. And with
this broken knife!</p>

<p>He groaned and looked around.</p>

<p>“O-oh!” he gave a sharp, startled cry. His
candle! Only an inch of it was left. Oh! he
<i>must</i> get out! How terrible it would be here in
the pitch-black, shut-in dark!</p>

<p>He seized a broken bit of timber for a makeshift
spade, and gave a hurried stroke. Alas!
The old timber snapped in two, bruising and cutting
his hands cruelly. He threw aside the useless
fragment and then, as if he had lost the
power of motion, he stood staring at his bit
of candle that shortened with every passing
second.</p>

<p>He pulled himself together. He must view
every foot, every inch of the pit, so that he could
work to purpose in the dark, not just dig, dig,
dig, and get nowhere. He scrutinized the wall,
noting every angle and projection; then he looked
up, and studied the position of every log, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
broken pole. For the first time, he observed a
log that did not extend across the pit; its end was
about two feet from the wall. Ah! perhaps, perhaps—</p>

<p>He jerked the string out of his pocket, made a
slip noose, and threw it at the end of the log; the
noose fell short. He threw it again; and again it
went aside. The next time, it caught a broken
pole, and to get it off he had to poke and push
with a piece of timber for two or three minutes—minutes
that seemed hours as he glanced fearfully
at the flickering candle. He threw the noose
again; and at last it went over the log. He tried
to pull it along. He wanted to get it near the
middle, free of the broken poles, and pull himself
up by it, if—oh! how he prayed it was!—stout
enough to bear his weight; but now it was fast on
a knot and he could not move it.</p>

<p>He glanced at the candle. It was a mere bit
of wick in a gob of grease; every flicker threatened
to be its last. He could not wait any longer!
he must do something! something! He would
pull himself up to the end of the log and try to
break through the poles.</p>

<p>As he pulled, the log began to move. Ah! If
he could pull the end into the pit, it would be
a bridge to climb out on. He jerked with
all his might, and it moved, slid, slipped downward;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the end caught against a projecting
rock about four feet from the top; there it held
fast.</p>

<p>The candle flame flared and dropped and—no,
it was not out; not yet.</p>

<p>Dick jumped up and caught hold of the log.
The movement fanned the failing light; it spurted
and went out. No matter now! He had firm
hold of the log. He scrambled up on it and managed
presently to push and pull himself between
the broken poles. At last, at last, thank Heaven!
he was out of that awful pit.</p>

<p>He staggered along, feeling his way by the
wall, making one ascent after another, until a
light glimmered before him and he reached the
entrance well. He raised his ladder and climbed
out. Then his strength gave way. He dropped
down on a pile of leaves at the mine entrance,
and lay there, gazing blankly at the blue
sky shining beyond the fretwork of budding
branches.</p>

<p>Suddenly he began to laugh. He sat up and
slapped his knees. “I’ll pass it on to them,” he
said. “I’ll cover up that hole, and I’ll take Dave
and Steve there—after I find <i>it</i>—and let them
tumble in without a light. Then I’ll go off and
pretend I don’t hear them, and—oh! I’ll let them
stay there long enough for them to think, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
feel—” His face was suddenly solemn. “I might
have stayed there and died. Died!”</p>

<p>He got up and dragged the ladder out, and hid
it under the leaves piled against the fence.</p>

<p>“I reckon I ought not to expect to find it right
away,” he sighed. “I’ve got to keep on looking
and looking and looking. And I say I will! But
I need some real tools. A knife, specially a
broken one, isn’t much force for mining.”</p>

<p>He went toward home, but he was in no hurry
to complete the journey at the end of which were
his unfinished task and his father. Instead of
going down The Street, he took The Back Way
behind the Court-house, and slipped around the
corner of the blacksmith shop.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallett, the blacksmith, with only his corncob
pipe for company, was sitting in a chair tilted
against the door jamb of the grimy log cabin. He
was a vivacious little man with blue eyes and
dark hair, and a face that would have been sallow
if it had been visible under the grime. All the
Village boys liked to loaf at his shop, but Dick
had now a special reason for visiting him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Mallett—” Dick began.</p>

<p>The smith started. “You young imp!” he exclaimed.
“What do you mean by jumping at me,
sudden as a jack-in-the-box? I wasn’t thinking
’bout you—and here you are, close enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
hear my very thoughts. I never see such a boy.
Why, what’s the matter with your face?”</p>

<p>“I fell down. It got scratched,” Dick explained
briefly. “Mr. Mallett, I was thinking
about the Old Sterling Mine, near your great-grandfather’s
shop. Do you reckon it was silver,
real silver, he got there?”</p>

<p>“Do I reckon? No, I don’t! I know it, sure
and certain as I’m setting here in this chair,
smoking my corncob pipe. Aint I heard my
father tell time and again what his granddad
told him? Why, my father could remember him
good. He was a little quick man with blue eyes
and black hair—we all get our favor from him.
He never did learn to talk like folks over here;
he always mixed his words and gave ’em curious-sounding
twists. He come from France, one of
Lafayette’s soldiers he was.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t he go back with Lafayette?”
asked Dick. “I should think he’d have been lonesome
here, away from his own home and folks.”</p>

<p>“Certainly he was lonesome,” said Mr. Mallett.
“My father said, when he was old and child-like,
he’d set in the corner, jabbering French by
the hour, with tears dripping down his face.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why he stayed here,” persisted
Dick.</p>

<p>“He just stayed and kept staying,” said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
smith. “Maybe that old silver mine had something
to do with it. He was always expecting to
get out a fortune. He come with the Frenchers
to chase Cornwallis, and they stopped here, two
or three days, to mend shoes and get victuals.</p>

<p>“The old Mr. Osborne that owned Larkland
in them days see what a good blacksmith my
great-grandad was, and told him when the war
was over to come back here and he should have a
home. So he did, and the squire helped him get
some of the old glebe land, and he married Mr.
Osborne’s overseer’s daughter. He had a smithy
on the Old Plank Road by Mine Creek. I reckon
you know the place.”</p>

<p>Dick nodded. He did not say he had been
there that very afternoon.</p>

<p>“And he found silver on that hill. My grand-daddy
used to tell us children about seeing his
father getting silver out of the ground and beating
it on his anvil with his sledge hammer. And
Black Mayo that’s always finding out something
’bout everything, he found them old <i>ree</i>cord
papers.”</p>

<p>“And they proved about the silver mine?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Certainly they did,” asserted Mr. Mallett.
“Would folks try a man in law court for making
money out of silver he didn’t have? Great-granddad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
didn’t deny making of it. He just said he
wasn’t making no false coins. He was hammering
out sterling pure silver. That’s why they call
it the Sterling Mine. And he was making pieces
like Spanish six shilling pieces—our folks counted
money by shillings in them days—and was giving
them, in place of what they called alloy; he was
giving better and purer money than the law. And
what could folks say to that? Why, nothing; for
it was the truth.”</p>

<p>“And so they didn’t punish him?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Punish him? What for? For doing better
than the law of the land? No, sirree!”</p>

<p>“I don’t reckon he got out all the silver,” said
Dick, more to himself than to Mr. Mallett.</p>

<p>“Course not! Some was got out in my father’s
day, by the Mr. Mayo that owned the land before
The War.”</p>

<p>“How did they get it out?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Dug it out with tools, of course. Aint there
the old picks and sledges and things, setting there
in that shed, that my father made for them?
And Mr. Mayo—”</p>

<p>“Are they—”</p>

<p>Dick tried to interrupt, but Mr. Mallett went
on with what he had to say: “He aint made
much out of it. They say it was what they call
‘free silver’, and great-granddad chanced to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
strike where it was rich. It petered out, and
silver was so scarce and the rock so hard it didn’t
pay to work the mine. Some folks say that.
There was a tale that the manager wasn’t trying
to make it pay; he wanted to get the mine for
himself. He tried to buy it. But he didn’t. He
died. Anyway, The War came, and ’twasn’t
worked any more.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Dick accepted the fact that The War
ended everything, even the worth of the silver
mine. “It does seem, if it was real silver, we
could see it there now,” he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Shucks!” Mr. Mallett got up and knocked
the ashes out of his pipe. “Course they took out
all in sight. Folks would have to dig for any
more they got.”</p>

<p>“And the tools; will you—” Dick checked
himself. If he asked for the tools now, Mr. Mallett
would guess what he was planning to do and
somehow all The Village would know before sunset.
He must wait and manage to get them, without
betraying his purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallett was looking at the westering sun.
“Fayett ought to be home,” he said. “He went
to Redville, and he was to be back in time to help
me with a little work.”</p>

<p>“Fayett!” exclaimed Dick. “Why, I didn’t
know he came home for Easter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Yes,” said Mr. Mallett. “He’s mighty stirred
up ’bout this war. What have we got to do with
Europe’s war that started with the killing of a
little prince in a country I’d never heard tell of?
But Fayett’s got a notion in his head— Here!
I’ve got to fix some rivets. Don’t you want to
blow the bellows?”</p>

<p>“I wish I had time,” said Dick. “I’ve got to go
home. I—I haven’t finished my garden work.”</p>

<p>“Then I reckon you’ll save it for another day,”
said the smith. “Sun’s ’most down.”</p>

<p>Its long rays lay like a red-gold band across
The Street, as Dick started home, wishing—too
late!—that he had finished his garden task and
postponed his adventuring to another day. Seeing
his father on the porch, the truant slipped behind
the boxwood at the edge of the walk. But
Mr. Osborne called, “Dick!” and then more
sternly, “Richard!”</p>

<p>It was useless to pretend not to hear.</p>

<p>“Sir!” Dick answered meekly.</p>

<p>“Have you completed your garden work?”</p>

<p>“Not—not quite, sir,” said Dick. “I am just
going to it now, sir. I can get a lot done before
dark. And I’ll get up soon Monday morning,
and finish it, sir, indeed I will.”</p>

<p>“My son,—” Mr. Osborne spoke in a magisterial
voice and took Dick by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Just then the front gate clicked, and Black
Mayo came up the walk.</p>

<p>“War has been declared,” he said without a
word of greeting. “War! The United States
has declared war with Germany.”</p>

<p>Red Mayo dropped Dick’s arm. “How’d you
hear?”</p>

<p>“I met Fayett Mallett coming from Redville.
He’d heard the news, if we can call it news. We
knew it was coming.”</p>

<p>“Of course; it was inevitable. We knew that
the minute we read the President’s War Message.
He held off as long as he could.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Now the War Resolution has passed
Congress and the President has signed it.”</p>

<p>Dick stood listening a minute, then slipped indoors
just as his mother came out.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” she asked.
“What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“War!” said her husband. “The United States
is in the War, Miranda.”</p>

<p>Sweet William was at his mother’s elbow. He
spoke in a puzzled little voice. “I thought The
War was done. I thought the Confedacy was
overrun.”</p>

<p>“This is another war, son,” laughed Mr. Osborne.
“This is war with Germany.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST then Emma came to the door. Emma
was the Osbornes’ old servant, brown and
plump as one of her own baked apple dumplings,
and as much a part of the family as the
tall clock in “the chamber.”</p>

<p>“Supper is ready, Miss M’randa, an’ you-all
come right away, please’m,” she said. “De muffins
is light as a feather. Come on an’ butter
’em. If you-all will live on corn bread, please’m
eat it hot.”</p>

<p>“Poor Emma!” laughed Mrs. Osborne. “She
cannot reconcile herself to our food program.”</p>

<p>“I tell Emma ’bout the Belgians,” complained
Sweet William. “But she says ‘them folks is too
far off for her to bother ’bout; corn bread don’t
set good on her stomach; and she’s going to eat
what she likes, long as she can get it.’ And,
mother, she has light bread and hot biscuits for
herself every day, and—”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh, son boy!” said Mrs. Osborne. “Emma
doesn’t know any better, and we do. Come,
Mayo, and Mayo. Come to the hot corn muffins!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“I ought to go home,” said Black Mayo.
“Polly’ll be expecting me.”</p>

<p>“Indeed she will not,” said Mrs. Osborne.
“Polly never expects you till she sees you coming
in the gate. How is she, and how are your
pigeons? I understand they are a part of your
family now. Of course you’ll stay to supper,
Mayo. Patsy, tell Emma to put another plate on
the table.”</p>

<p>A visit from their Cousin Mayo, always a delight,
was now especially welcome to Dick because
it postponed, perhaps prevented, a disagreeable
interview with his father. He slipped to his place
and quietly devoted himself to the hot muffins,
cold ham, and damson preserves.</p>

<p>“Why, Dick! What have you done to your
face?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“Nothing. It got scratched,” he mumbled,
glancing at his father.</p>

<p>But Mr. Osborne was not thinking of the
garden; he was about to present to his family an
amazing piece of news. He prepared for it by
an impressive “Ahem!” with his eyes fixed on
Black Mayo.</p>

<p>“A client came to my office to-day,” he said
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Really, Mayo!” exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>“What is a client?” asked Sweet William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Who disturbed the hoary dust of your
sanctum?” asked Black Mayo.</p>

<p>“Well may you inquire!” said the Village
lawyer. “You are responsible for his coming.”</p>

<p>“I?” There was a look of blank astonishment,
followed by a peal of laughter. “You don’t mean
to say that scoundrel Smith—”</p>

<p>“Yes. He wants to take action against you for
assault and battery.”</p>

<p>“What is a client?” Sweet William asked
again.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you talking about?” inquired
Mrs. Osborne.</p>

<p>“Oh, I reckon I know.” Patsy eagerly aired
her knowledge. “That Smith, the new man at
the Tolliver place, quarreled with Cousin Mayo,
and Cousin Mayo knocked him down. We saw it,
Anne and I.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Princess Pocahontas! Are you and Lady
Anne taking the witness stand against me?”
Black Mayo said in mock reproach. “Well, it’s
true.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne gave a little exclamation of
horror. “Oh, Mayo!” she said, frowning at her
husband. “I’ve begged you not to let outside
people buy land around here. And now Mayo’s
had to knock one of them down.”</p>

<p>“But, Miranda dear, when a man sells his farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
and the purchaser comes to get me to look up
the title—”</p>

<p>“You just ought to tell him we don’t want him
here,” said Mrs. Osborne. “What is the use of
being a lawyer if you can’t put some law on outsiders
to keep them from spoiling The Village?”</p>

<p>The two men laughed.</p>

<p>Then Black Mayo said: “I suppose he told you
about it, Mayo. The ‘I saids’ and ‘he saids’?”</p>

<p>“Yes; oh, yes!”</p>

<p>“H’m! I hope you’ll make him pay you a good
fat fee for the case.”</p>

<p>“Fee!” Red Mayo stared in amazement. “Assuredly
you don’t think I’d accept his dirty
money! Case! I informed him he had none.”</p>

<p>“But I did knock him down.”</p>

<p>“Of course you did. When he repeated what
he said, I’d have knocked him down myself, if
he hadn’t been in my own office. I told him if The
Village heard such talk, he’d be tarred and
feathered and drummed out of the community.
Then I ordered him out of my office.”</p>

<p>“And that is how you treat your <i>rara avis</i>, a
client!” said Black Mayo.</p>

<p>“What is a client?” repeated Sweet William,
whose questions were always answered because
he never stopped asking till they were.</p>

<p>“A client, young man, is the golden-egg goose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
that a lawyer tries to lure into his coop,” Black
Mayo explained. “One fluttered to your father
and he shooed it away.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had a goose that laid gold eggs,” said
Sweet William. “I wouldn’t kill it, like the silly
man in that story.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can find one and trade it to you for
Hop-o-hop,” suggested his cousin.</p>

<p>Sweet William considered and shook his head.
“Hop-o-hop couldn’t get on without me,” he said
gravely.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s a family failing,” laughed Black
Mayo, as they left the table. “None of you is
willing to pay the price for the goose.”</p>

<p>The evening was so mild that they settled
themselves again on the porch. The men resumed
their discussion of the war; David pored
over a bulletin about corn; Dick snuggled down
in a corner with “The Days of Bruce”; Anne and
Patsy brought out their Red Cross knitting, and
whispered and giggled together. Sweet William
put a stool beside his mother’s chair and cuddled
against her knee, with Scalawag at his feet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne left the discussion of public affairs
to the menfolks. She was intent on her own
task, the making out of a program for the Village
Literary Society. What pleasant meetings they
would have, reading about the Plantagenet kings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
supplementing Hume’s history with Waverley
novels and Shakespeare plays. She smiled and
folded her paper.</p>

<p>As the twilight deepened, Dick shut his book
and grinned at the girls.</p>

<p>“Too bad not to have your company on my
walk to-day, after you promised it, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh! we thought of a nicer place to go, where
we wouldn’t scratch our faces,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“We’ll go with you some day, after you tear
down all the barbed wire and briers,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“I dare you!” Dick defied them.</p>

<p>“You say that because you know I’m going
away so soon,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“You’re coming back in June. I dare and
double dare you for then,” replied Dick. “I’ll be
going to this place—oh! right along.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Anne. “We’ll follow you;
see if we don’t. We’ll not take a dare; will we,
Patsy-pet?”</p>

<p>Their bickering was interrupted by the approach
of guests. Three men strolled across the
yard—Giles Spotswood, the cousin from the
mill; Will Blair, another cousin, who kept the
Village post office; and old Mr. Tavis, a villager
outside the cousinship.</p>

<p>“We saw Black Mayo here, and we dropped in
to talk over the news,” said Mr. Blair. “Giles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
says Fayett Mallett heard at Redville that the
United States has declared war. That’s what
comes of sinking American ships; eh, Mayo?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Black Mayo; “the German
sinking of American ships was the overt act
which brought on this war, just as the Stamp
Tax brought on the Revolution. But at bottom,
in both cases, the real cause is the same: it’s a
fight against a despotic government for liberty
and human rights.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange the Germans kept up submarine
fighting after the United States’ protests,” said
Mr. Blair; “getting another powerful enemy.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they count on winning the war with
U-boats before the United States gets over there
with both feet,” answered Black Mayo. “But
I’ll bet on the British Navy; it’s saved the Allies
so far.”</p>

<p>“You said the Belgians saved them by that
ten days of defense that gave the French and
British time to come,” said David.</p>

<p>“You told me the French saved them by driving
the Germans back at the battle of the Marne,”
said Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh! but you said the stubborn retreat of that
first little British army was a real victory that
made possible the Marne victory,” Patsy reminded
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Well, well! a good deal of saving is necessary;
and maybe the old United States will jump in and
do the final saving.”</p>

<p>“The French and British are pushing forward
now,” said Mr. Blair. “Yesterday’s paper
says——”</p>

<p>The men discussed the war news in an interested
but remote way, just as they had discussed
plagues in India, famines in China, the
Boer War. Their sympathies were as wide as
humanity; but, after all, these things did not
touch them, really and personally, as did the
death of Joe Spencer’s little daughter or the
burning of a negro cabin with a baby in it. No
one said “we” about the war; it was always
“they.”</p>

<p>“What do you reckon they will do?” asked Mr.
Spotswood. “Will they send an army over, do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Red Mayo answered confidently.
“The war will be over before they could send men
abroad, even if they had a trained army ready to
start. They’ll lend the Allies money; they’ll
give some—large amounts, millions, no doubt.
And they’ll supply food and munitions; they must
hustle around and get ships.”</p>

<p>“The main job will be to get the food to send,”
said Mr. Spotswood. “There’s an alarming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
shortage of grain. I never saw it so scarce and
high, since I’ve been milling. The first war work
is the farmers’, to raise a bumper crop.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m in war work, father,” said David.
“I’m going to beat the record on my corn acre
this year.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “A poor war worker! Not
even a one-horse farmer, just a one-acre boy!”</p>

<p>“My one-acre boy multiplied by hundreds of
thousands makes the Boys’ Corn Club a big
thing,” said Mr. Spotswood. “Why aren’t you
in it, Dick?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got something better to do,” said Dick,
confidently and mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange the Germans don’t see they
are beaten?” said Mr. Blair.</p>

<p>“Man, man! What are you talking about?”
Black Mayo exclaimed. “Beaten? In three
years of war, German soil has been trampled by
enemy feet only once, those few days in that first
August when the French invaded Alsace. I fear
there’s a hard struggle and dark days ahead.”</p>

<p>This speech amazed every one.</p>

<p>“Why, Cousin Mayo! Can’t the United States
whip the world?” exclaimed David.</p>

<p>“Aren’t most of the nations against Germany?”
asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! A score of nations are united<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
against Germany and her sister autocracies, Austria-Hungary
and Turkey and Bulgaria.”</p>

<p>“Is Germany so much the best fighter?” David
wanted to know.</p>

<p>“No! But she has the inside lines, and she was
ready for war. For nearly forty years she was
preparing for ‘the day,’ while the rest of the
world was busy with works of peace.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the other countries have armies and
navies, too?” David persisted.</p>

<p>“No country ever built up such a perfect war
machine as Germany,” said Mr. Osborne. “Every
point was prepared. Optical and dye experts
produced an inconspicuous gray-green uniform;
engineers constructed the Kiel Canal and a network
of railroads leading to Belgium and France;
scientists captured nitrogen from the air for explosives
and fertilizers, and devised Zeppelins,
huge guns, submarines, and poison gas; experts
made war plans; officers were drilled to carry
them out with soldiers trained by years of service.
And the minds of people were prepared—abroad
by propaganda, and at home by patriotic-sounding
talk about ‘the seas must be free’ and
‘we demand our place in the sun.’ Even Kuno——”
He paused and then said to himself, “I
wonder where Kuno is!”</p>

<p>“Kuno?” said Red Mayo, questioningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Kuno Kleist, a German friend of mine with
whom I tramped through Mexico. He was
coming home with me, but he had news that his
mother was ill, so he went back to Germany.
Such a clever, merry, kind-hearted fellow he was;
confident that the eternal jubilee of peace and
brotherhood was at hand, ‘made in Germany,’ by
his Socialist brethren.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blair laughed. “Now we are seeing what
is really ‘made in Germany’ by your friend Kuno
Kleist and the others.”</p>

<p>Black Mayo shook his head. “Not Kuno, not
the will and heart of him. They may have his
body—I hope not, I hope not—as a cog in this terrible
military machine, crushing helpless nations
and people with its awful policy of frightfulness.”</p>

<p>“They ought all to be killed, them German
scoundrels ought,” wheezed old Mr. Tavis.
“They ought to be treated like they treat the
Belgians and them other people Will Blair reads
us about in his newspaper.”</p>

<p>“No and no!” Black Mayo said emphatically;
then he went on, looking not at Mr. Tavis, but
at David and Dick: “The worst thing that could
happen to the world, to us, would be to be infected
by the germ of hate.”</p>

<p>“But the Germans do such mean things, Cousin
Mayo. How can we not hate them?” Patsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
looked up with a frown. “Father read in the paper
to-day that two more relief ships have been sunk,
ships loaded with food for the starving Belgians.”</p>

<p>“And I gave all my money to buy it,” said
Sweet William, indignantly. “I’m saving my
sugar for the poor little Belgians. Do you reckon
the Germans’ll sink that, too?”</p>

<p>“Relief ships!” said David. “Why, they sink
hospital ships, with wounded soldiers and doctors
and nurses; and ships with women and babies.
Remember the <i>Lusitania</i>!”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to hate them,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“No, dear, no,” said Black Mayo. “We ought
to fight fair and hard and without hate, for our
own rights and the rights of all people, the Germans,
too. Why, the German people had no voice
in making this war. It was declared by the
kaiser without consulting the <i>Reichstag</i> in which
the people are represented.</p>

<p>“Remember, children, most wars are made by
governments, against the wishes and interests of
the people. War is a disaster, a scourge; war,
more than famine, is the seven blasted ears of
corn, the seven lean-fleshed kine, destroying the
full and the well-favored. All the waste and woe
of this World War will be worth while if they
make people realize the horror and wickedness
of war and put an end to it forever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“You are talking over their heads,” laughed
Red Mayo.</p>

<p>“I am not sure of that,” said Black Mayo,
looking at David’s thoughtful face. “And if I
am, it is not a bad thing for young folks to have
things above them to grow up to.”</p>

<p>“Dick, get a chair for Cousin Alice Blair,”
said Mrs. Osborne, as a fat, smiling woman
waddled up the path. “She likes the big rocker.
Get two chairs, son. There’s Miss Fanny coming
down The Street, and she’ll stop to find out
what we are talking about.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, Miss Fanny Morrison turned in
at the gate. She was the Village seamstress, a
blunt-featured, blunt-mannered, kind-hearted
woman who lived with an invalid sister in a
cottage across the street from the Osborne
home.</p>

<p>“I saw you-all out here and I just had to come
in,” she said. “Oh! you’re talking about this
war. Is it really true that the United States is
in it? Isn’t it awful? War is a terrible thing.
I certainly am glad I don’t live in a country that
is in it, I mean, really in it. My mother said
that during The War they used to——” She
carried the conversation away from the war that
was convulsing the world, to their “The War,”
fought before they were born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“Did the supervisors appropriate money for
our veterans to go to the Reunion, Mayo?” Mrs.
Osborne asked presently.</p>

<p>“The treasury’s almost empty,” answered her
husband. “They gave what they had. And
we started a subscription to make up the
deficit.”</p>

<p>“We can raise part of the money by selling
lunches on the Green during court week,” said
Mrs. Osborne.</p>

<p>Patsy spoke quickly. “Oh, no, mother! You
forget I told you the school’s going to serve
lunches that week for the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne turned a surprised, indignant
face to her daughter. “Why, my dear! Aren’t
you patriotic enough to give up any other plans
for the sake of our dear old Confederate soldiers?”</p>

<p>Patsy hung her head, with a submissive
mumble.</p>

<p>Sweet William, now nestling against his
mother’s knee, put a caressing hand on her cheek
to demand attention.</p>

<p>“Mother, is Virginia the United States, too?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“Virginia the United States?” repeated his
mother.</p>

<p>“Virginians used to be accused of thinking so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
son,” said Mr. Osborne, laughing. “It is the
general opinion that our State is a part of the
Union; it’s so on the map.”</p>

<p>“Then if Virginia is in the United States, we
are, too; aren’t we, father?”</p>

<p>“We certainly are, son; we are whatever Virginia
is,” declared Mr. Osborne.</p>

<p>“Then we are in this war.” Sweet William
imparted the information solemnly, as his own
special discovery. “Virginia’s the United States,
and we are Virginia; and so we are in the war!”</p>

<p>“It sounds reasonable, son,” remarked his
father, with a dry chuckle, “but you are the first
of us who has thought of it.”</p>

<p>While they were laughing over Sweet William’s
great discovery, two men, one leading a
horse, turned from The Back Way into The
Street and came toward the Osborne home.</p>

<p>Black Mayo jumped up.</p>

<p>“There’s Jack Mallett bringing Rosinante,”
he said. “I left her at the shop to be shod, and
told him I’d be back in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“We all know the length of your ‘ten
minutes,’” laughed Mrs. Osborne.</p>

<p>“It’s your fault, Miranda, all your fault,”
Black Mayo turned on her. “You asked me to
stay to supper; and you know I never know when
to go home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>By this time, Mr. Mallett and his son were
at the steps, receiving a cordial greeting. They
were a little circle of friends, gentlefolks and
seamstress and blacksmith, who had grown up
together in The Village.</p>

<p>As children and men and women, in school and
shop and church, they played and worked and
worshipped together. Each stood on his own
merits, and only old negroes spoke slightingly
of “poor white trash.” But the class lines were
there, as deep or even deeper than when they
were marked by wealth and land and slaves. An
Osborne or Wilson or Mayo was—oh, well! an
Osborne or Wilson or Mayo, and not a Tavis
or Jones or Hight.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Jack——” began Black
Mayo, going to get his horse.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s all right,” interrupted Mr. Mallett.
“I was shutting up the shop and I saw you here,
so I thought I’d bring the mare. She don’t like
to stand tied.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Come in, Jack; come in, you and Fayett, and
sit awhile,” said Red Mayo, heartily.</p>

<p>“No, Red; no, Miss Miranda, thank you,” replied
Mr. Mallett. “I can’t set down. I’ve got
to go straight home. I promised my old woman I
would.” But he tarried to share his news with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
them. “You’ve been talking ’bout the war, I
reckon. Fayett heard to-day at Redville the Congress
has voted for it. And—what do you think?—he’s
going to give up agricultural school and
be a soldier.”</p>

<p>“Fayett a soldier!” exclaimed Dick, looking
at his neighbor with amazement and a sort of
awe.</p>

<p>The elders, too, were exclaiming and questioning,
looking at the boy whom they had known
all his life as if he had suddenly become a
stranger. That a Village boy was going as a soldier
did not bring home to them the fact that
the World War had become an American war;
it merely seemed to carry him away from them,
making him a part of that mighty overseas conflict.</p>

<p>“Is Fayett really going?” asked Miss Fanny
Morrison.</p>

<p>“Well, he wants to, and my old woman and
me’ve been talking it over and we’ve done both
give our consent; so I reckon it’s settled,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“How could his mother agree?” As Mrs. Osborne
asked the question, her hold tightened on
the man child drowsing at her knee.</p>

<p>“He told us he felt he ought to go, and she
says she wouldn’t stand in the way of anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
he thought he ought to do,” Mr. Mallett said
quietly. “And if his mother can give him up,
I’ve got no right to hold him back.”</p>

<p>“But, Fayett,—” Mr. Blair turned to the boy—“I
don’t understand your wanting to go. You
were always such a peaceable fellow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the lad, as if that were a reason
for him to fight in this war. “And now that the
United States is in it, it seems like I must go. Of
free will. Not waiting to be sent.”</p>

<p>He spoke as an American, but those listening
remembered that he was the great-great-grandson
of a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Black Mayo turned to Mr. Mallett. “Well,
well, well! Your great-grandfather came here
to fight for American liberty, and now your son
is going to France to fight for freedom there.
Wouldn’t that old Mallett of the mine be proud
of Fayett? Ah, it’s fine to act so that our ancestors
might be proud of us! God bless you,
boy!”</p>

<p>He wrung Fayett’s hand, man to man, and
then took his bridle rein.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Jack,” he said again. “Good
night, folks. It’s ten minutes to eight. Polly is
locking the back door this minute, and when I get
there she’ll be settled with her knitting. Come to
see us, all of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>He paused in the yard and said, “Mayo, a
word with you.” Then he said in an undertone:
“It’s best to keep quiet about what happened to-day.
Tell Anne and Patsy so. That fellow
Smith doesn’t understand how we feel about
things. If his foolish speech gets abroad, it will
injure him. Maybe I was a little too quick on the
trigger.”</p>

<p>He swung into the saddle and the roan mare
galloped away.</p>

<p>While the other guests were saying good night,
Dick slipped to his bedroom, avoiding a private
interview with his father.</p>

<p>“He won’t punish me to-morrow,” he said.
“It’s Sunday, Easter Sunday.”</p>

<p>Easter Sunday! And America, that had
striven so hard for peace, had been whirled into
the red World War.</p>

<p>But it was not of the nation that Mrs. Osborne
was thinking as she put Sweet William to bed.</p>

<p>“Poor Mrs. Mallett!” she said to herself.
“What if it were my boy that is going?” And
she kissed her little son so fiercely that he stirred
and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said drowsily, “will my sugar
be enough——”</p>

<p>He was asleep before the question was finished.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DICK was up early Monday morning,
meekly and diligently hoeing the potato
patch. But his father had seen this humility
and industry follow too many offenses to
overlook Saturday’s disobedience; so the culprit
received a severe lecture ending with the command
to spend his Saturday afternoons for a
month working in the garden.</p>

<p>A month! A whole month before he could
go back to the Old Sterling Mine! All that he
could do, in the meantime, to help carry out his
plan of working the mine and making a fortune,
was to get tools and collect candles.</p>

<p>He rummaged among the old irons in the blacksmith’s
shed on several afternoons, under pretense
of finding horseshoes.</p>

<p>“What’s this old tool; and that one?” he asked
with assumed carelessness, pulling out one after
another, until he identified and set aside some that
the miners had used.</p>

<p>Then he chose an occasion when Mr. Mallett
was busy shoeing a fractious mule and said in
an offhand way: “Mr. Mallett, I want to dig a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
hole, where I reckon there’s rock. May I take
some of the old tools out of your shed?”</p>

<p>“Help yourself.”</p>

<p>“And I needn’t bring them back right away?”</p>

<p>Mr. Mallett did not look up from his task.
“Keep ’em long as you please. They’re there to
sell for old iron. Whoa, you brute!”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” Dick went away then, but at
dusk that evening he slipped back to the shop and
got the pick and spade and sledge hammer he had
set aside, and sped down the unlighted street and
deposited them under the churchyard hedge.</p>

<p>Many an hour, during the days that followed,
while he sat with a textbook in his hand, he
was in fancy unearthing vast treasures and displaying
them to the envy and admiration of his
comrades. Slowly, oh! very slowly, the days
went by that kept him chained to his tasks at
home.</p>

<p>One pleasant afternoon in mid-April, the children
drifted out of school, in the usual merry
chattering groups. The Village schoolhouse was
across The Street from The Roost. It was a
quaint, ivy-mantled brick cottage, the old “office,”
in the corner of the yard at Broad Acres. Broad
Acres, once a lordly estate, was now “broad
acres” in name only. Farm after farm, field
after field, had passed from the family ownership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
until the mansion, with the rambling yard and
garden, was all that was left.</p>

<p>The house was a stately red-brick building with
wide halls and spacious, high-ceilinged rooms.
Mrs. Wilson, who lived there with her daughter
Ruth, spent her days teaching A B C’s to babies
and preparing Dick and the older boys for the university.
People who were able paid her in money
or wood or meal or shoes, and she accepted their
pupils and fees, but oh! how she struggled to get
the children whose parents were too poor to pay
for schooling or to realize its value.</p>

<p>“I wish and I wish you weren’t going away,
Anne, you precious darling Anne!” Patsy wailed
for the twentieth time, giving Anne Lewis a
frantic embrace.</p>

<p>“It’s a horrid shame!” exclaimed Ruth
Wilson.</p>

<p>“But I’m coming back in the summer,” Anne
said, to comfort them and herself. “Oh! and,
Patsy, won’t we have a lovely time, going around
with Dick!” she said, with a mischievous glance
at Patsy’s twin.</p>

<p>“Bet you will—not!” declared Dick.</p>

<p>“And think what a good time we’ll all have
at Happy Acres.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go to Happy Acres now,” suggested
David Spotswood. “We boys will catch some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
fish—maybe, and you girls can get flowers, and
we’ll come home by the mill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! let’s do that,” exclaimed Anne. “You
can go, can’t you, Patsy? Ruth? Alice?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can, to stay all afternoon,”
Patsy said regretfully. “Our Red Cross box is
to go off next week and I’m not half done my
sweater.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to f-finish my scarf,” stammered Ruth.</p>

<p>“I want to knit another pair of socks, if I have
time,” said Alice.</p>

<p>The Village was working and denying itself
to help stricken France and Belgium. If the contributions
were not large in dollars and cents,
they were great in the efforts and self-sacrifice of
the little country neighborhood. But the offerings
came from the hands of good Samaritans,
not of patriots. America had accepted the war;
it had not yet come home to The Village. Later
on, it was to—but we shall see what we see.</p>

<p>“Oh, you girls!” grumbled Stephen Tavis.
“You are doing that Red Cross stuff all the time.”</p>

<p>“And you boys are playing while we work,”
said Patsy, tossing her head.</p>

<p>“We are saving flour and sugar for the Belgians.
Do you want us to knit and sew?” laughed
Dick.</p>

<p>“Some of the boys in Washington are knitting,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Anne said gravely; “and lots of men, real
men, like firemen and soldiers. And they—we—are
all making gardens, so there will be more food
to send to hungry France and Belgium.”</p>

<p>“Father read from the paper last night something
the President said,” said Patsy. “‘Every
one who makes or works a garden helps to solve
the problem of feeding the nations.’”</p>

<p>“Yes, the President says the fate of the nation
and the world rests largely on the farmer,” said
David, importantly. “He wants them to plant
food crops; and that’s what I am doing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your old corn acre! You’re so biggity
about it,” jeered Dick.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind a little farm work or gardening;
but I certainly draw the line at knitting,”
said Steve.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! oh!” Anne jumped up and down, uttering
little squeals of excitement. “Steve! David!
Dick! Why don’t you have a school war garden?”</p>

<p>“A school garden?” questioned Steve.</p>

<p>“Yes; like we have in Washington, that all the
pupils work in,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“Thank you! I get enough gardening at
home,” said Dick, sourly. “I don’t want to spend
all my life hung to one end of a stick with a hoe
at the other end.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but this is fun, and good war work too.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
It takes just a few hours a week from each of us.
The more there are to help, the less there is for
each one to do.” Then Anne went on indignantly:
“It seems to me you’d want to help, you
boys, when you think about all those poor people
over there, old folks and children and women
with babies, homeless and without food. Hundreds
and thousands of them stand in line for
hours every day to get a little soup and a piece
of bread; and if we in America don’t provide that
bread and soup, they’ll starve.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make a garden for them,” said a high,
sweet voice, quavering on the verge of tears.
“If I had a hoe and a place to work, I’d begin
right away. I ain’t quite as big as Dick, but
father says I’ve got mighty good muscle. Just
you feel it, Anne,” said Sweet William. “Where’s
a hoe? And where’s the garden going to be?”</p>

<p>“Yes; where could we have a garden?” said
Steve. “I don’t mind working a little, enough
to keep up with Sweet William, if we had a good
place.”</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any place. You see we can’t have
it,” Dick said triumphantly.</p>

<p>“There is; you can,” Anne declared vehemently.
“You may have my Happy Acres that
Cousin Rodney gave me. I’ll—yes, I’ll be willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and glad to dig up the flowers for potatoes and
things.” Her voice broke and she winked back
her tears.</p>

<p>“O-oh!”</p>

<p>“Why, Anne!”</p>

<p>“Of course you wouldn’t!”</p>

<p>“What’s this about digging up flowers?” Mrs.
Wilson, coming out of the schoolroom, with her
hands full of papers, heard Anne’s last words and
the horrified exclamations they excited. “Surely
you aren’t talking about dear Happy Acres?”</p>

<p>“Anne wants us to have a garden, a sort of
war garden,” explained Patsy.</p>

<p>“We have them in Washington, you know,
Cousin Agnes,” Anne said. “We raise lots of
vegetables, and it isn’t hard work, with so many
to help; and anyway, it’s worth working hard
for, to help feed the world when it’s hungry and
starving.”</p>

<p>“And Steve asked where the garden could be,”
Patsy continued her explanation. “Anne says
it can be Happy Acres, even if they have to dig
up the flowers.”</p>

<p>“That would be dreadful!” exclaimed Alice
Blair.</p>

<p>“It’s dreadfuller for people to be starving,”
said Anne.</p>

<p>“Shucks! We couldn’t work a garden at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Happy Acres,” said Dick. “By the time we
walked there after school, it would be time to
walk back to do our home work.”</p>

<p>“We could run,” suggested Sweet William.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson laughed with the others; then she
said: “Possibly you are right, Dick; and certainly
Anne is. Let me think a minute. If you
boys are willing to give part of your time to work
for the hungry, I will give part of my garden
and my help. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, thank you!” screeched Sweet
William.</p>

<p>“I’m Sweet William’s partner,” said Steve.</p>

<p>“I’ll help,” said Tom Walthall, “if you don’t
ask me to do too much.”</p>

<p>“So will I,” said Tom Mallett.</p>

<p>“I’ll help when pa can spare me,” promised Joe
Spencer.</p>

<p>“I will, if Baldie will,” said John Eppes, who
never wished to do anything without his brother
Archibald.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll be in it with the others,” said
Archie.</p>

<p>“Of course you will, David?” Anne appealed
to the silent boy whose voice she had expected to
hear first.</p>

<p>“There’s my corn acre——” David began
hesitatingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Of course!” laughed Dick.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” Anne said eagerly. “You’ve
done such splendid work, raising such fine corn
and winning prizes. You know so much more
than the rest of us about working crops that—why,
we need you dreadfully.”</p>

<p>David tried not to look pleased. “I’ll do what
I can,” he agreed. “But I just tell you, I’m not
going to neglect my corn acre for anything; that
I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Mrs. Wilson. “And
you, Dick—you’ll help, of course?”</p>

<p>“No; no, Cousin Agnes,” Dick answered positively.
“I’m getting enough garden work to last
my lifetime. And besides, I’ve got something
else to do, if I ever get a chance at it.”</p>

<p>“What part of the garden are you going to
give us, Cousin Agnes?” asked David.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and look over the ground,” said Mrs.
Wilson. “I’ve just had it plowed and harrowed,
ready for planting.”</p>

<p>She led the way to the big, old-fashioned garden.
In front were beds of hardy flowers, and
arbors and summerhouses covered with roses
and jasmine and honeysuckle. Back of the flowers
were vegetable beds and rows of raspberries
and gooseberries and fig bushes. And in a far
corner, hedged by boxwood and carpeted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
blue-starred periwinkle, rose the lichened marble
slabs of the family burying-ground.</p>

<p>David, the star member of the county Corn
Club, looked admiringly at the fertile vegetable
beds. “Gee!” he exclaimed. “I’d beat the record
if my corn acre was like this; it’s rich as
cream.”</p>

<p>“It has been a garden more than a hundred
years,” said Mrs. Wilson. “Broad Acres was
the first clearing in the wilderness where The
Village is now. Here, boys, I am going to give
you this sunny southeast square. Now, let’s see
who are our gardeners. You’ll join, won’t you,
Albert?” she said kindly to Albert Smith, who
stood uncomfortably apart from any of the
friendly groups.</p>

<p>“No. I can’t,” he said abruptly. Then he
turned his head with a queer little gesture as if
he were listening to hear how his speech sounded.
He added confusedly: “My uncle needs me to
come home. I came to ask the arithmetic page
lesson.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson indicated the page and then, as
he slipped away, she turned to the other boys.
All except Dick Osborne enrolled as members
of The Village War-Garden Club. Meanwhile,
the girls were whispering together, and Patsy
became their spokeswoman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>“Cousin Agnes,” she said, “we want to war-garden,
too.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, mother,” said Ruth. “We’ve been
having flower gardens; why c-can’t we raise real
things, beans and potatoes?”</p>

<p>“You can; of course you can,” said her mother.</p>

<p>There was a howl from the boys.</p>

<p>“We don’t want girls bothering around,” said
Archie. “Let them stay in the house and sew.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got their Red Cross stuff,” said
Steve. “That’s enough for them.”</p>

<p>“We girls have Red Cross work in Washington,
and we do war gardening, too. And who
suggested this garden, I’d like to know?” Anne
asked.</p>

<p>“That’s all right; suggest,” said Joe. “Girls
are good at talking; but we don’t want them
around in our way when we are working.”</p>

<p>There was a clamor of indignation from the
girls.</p>

<p>“Boys! Girls!” Mrs. Wilson said in her schoolroom
voice. In the silence that it brought, she
went on: “Of course the girls may have a garden,
if they wish. I’ll give them the strip of land by
the rose garden.”</p>

<p>But the girls scornfully rejected this offer.</p>

<p>“We don’t want a little ribbon like that,” said
Patsy. “We want a real garden or none at all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
We don’t care if you give us a bigger place than
the boys have—I’m sure we can manage it—but
we don’t want an inch less. There are more of
us than there are of them; two more, counting
Anne, who’s coming back in June.”</p>

<p>“Give us the square by the one the b-b-boys
have,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Oh, you greedy!” said David. “That would
be taking nearly all of Cousin Agnes’s garden,
these two big squares.”</p>

<p>“Make the boys divide their square with us,
Cousin Agnes,” suggested Patsy.</p>

<p>“No! no! no!” the boys objected loudly.</p>

<p>“Who’s greedy now?” Patsy inquired scornfully.</p>

<p>“G-g-give us that s-southwest square, mother,”
urged Ruth. “You and I don’t need such
a big garden. Let’s l-l-let the Belgians have it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Wilson agreed. She and Ruth
did need the garden; it was their main support;
but in this time of world need, they must give
not only all they were able, but more and still
more. She and Ruth would get on, somehow.
“You girls may have the square next to the
boys,” she said.</p>

<p>There were groans and cheers.</p>

<p>“We’ll see which do the best work. To-morrow
morning let’s meet here and start the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
planting. Bring hoes and rakes. I,” she added,
“will supply seeds.”</p>

<p>That meant another sacrifice. She and Ruth
would stint themselves to give for seed the peas
and beans and potatoes they had stored for food.</p>

<p>On the way home, Dick and some of the others
stopped at the post office. It occupied a corner
of Mr. Blair’s general merchandise shop and it
was, Black Mayo said, the Village club where
young and old gathered in the afternoons for
mail and gossip.</p>

<p>When Dick went in, there were a dozen villagers
and countrymen lounging in the room,
Mr. Blair was sorting the mail, and Black Mayo
was perched on the counter, reading the news in
Mr. Blair’s paper the only daily that came to The
Village.</p>

<p>“The British are holding Vimy Ridge,” he
said.</p>

<p>“What about Congress and army plans?”
asked Red Mayo.</p>

<p>“Congress is still discussing, discussing. Why
doesn’t it go ahead and put a draft bill in shape?
The President’s right; that’s the way to raise an
army.”</p>

<p>“Hey, Black Mayo! Here’s a letter for Polly,”
said Mr. Blair. “And here are two letters for
Mr. Carl Schmidt.” He looked around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>The man who lived at the old Tolliver place
came forward. “I guess they are for me,” he
said, “from somebody that did not know my
name; it’s Smith, good American Charley
Smith.”</p>

<p>“Carl Schmidt; that’s a queer-sounding name.
What is it?” asked Mr. Jones, a stout, red-faced
countryman.</p>

<p>“It is a German name,” Black Mayo said
crisply.</p>

<p>“My father did from Germany come,” the man
who called himself Smith said hastily, darting
an angry glance at Black Mayo and then looking
around without meeting any one’s eyes. “He
was sensible, and he did come to America. I
was here born. I am an American citizen.”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to be one of them low-down Germans,”
said Pete Walthall, taking a chew of
tobacco.</p>

<p>“<i>Ach!</i> so would I,” Smith proclaimed loudly.
“They are bad people. Awful bad people.” He
met defiantly Black Mayo’s quizzical eyes. “I
got no use for them German peoples.”</p>

<p>“Nobody has,” said Mr. Tavis.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Black Mayo declared. “I have.
One of my best friends is a German, a fine fellow
named Kuno Kleist that I spent months with, in
Mexico, helping him collect bugs and butterflies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Why, Mr. Mayo!” said Pete. “You mean to
say you don’t hate Germany?”</p>

<p>“I hate the Germany of Prussianism, power-mad
Junkerism, the ‘blood and iron’ of Frederick
the Great and Bismarck and Kaiser William,”
said Black Mayo; “but I love the Germany of
Goethe and Schiller and Luther and Beethoven.”</p>

<p>“Germany is one!” Mr. Smith’s voice rang out.
“It is one, I say.”</p>

<p>“So are we all, all one.” Black Mayo looked
around with a sudden winning smile. “Remember
that first Christmas when German and British
soldiers came out of the trenches to exchange
food and to talk together. ‘You are of the same
religion as we, and to-day is the Day of Peace,’
a German said to a Scottish officer. And those
men had to be transferred to other parts of the
line; they were enemies no longer, but friends;
they could not fight one another.</p>

<p>“Facts come out now and then that show the
difference in spirit between people and war lords.
A German paper recently announced that the
people of a certain town had been jailed for improper
conduct to prisoners and their names were
printed, to make their shame known to coming
generations.</p>

<p>“An American consul investigated the case.
He found that a trainload of Canadian prisoners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
had been sidetracked in the little town, and the
citizens had found out they were thirsty and
starving; so they brought food and drink. This
was the crime for which they were imprisoned
and held up to shame!</p>

<p>“Oh! the war lords are trying to carry out
their policy of frightfulness. But they have
studied history to little purpose if they think
Edith Cavell and the <i>Lusitania</i> victims and the
murdered Belgians and the tortured prisoners are
dead.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Cousin Mayo,” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Are the Greeks of Thermopylæ dead? Or
Roland and King Arthur, who perhaps never
lived?” Leaving Dick to make his own explanation,
Mr. Osborne turned to Mr. Blair. “Will,
give me two pounds of nails, please. I must be
going.”</p>

<p>“Going!” said Mr. Blair, in surprise. It was
an unwritten law that when a man came to the
post office he was to loaf there until night drove
him home.</p>

<p>“I’m busy making a new pigeon cote.”</p>

<p>“So you’ve gone back to the amusement of
your boyhood, eh?” said Mr. Blair, as he weighed
the nails.</p>

<p>There had always been pigeons at Larkland,
Black Mayo Osborne’s home. When the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
was built, the master, the first Osborne in Virginia,
erected a dovecote and stocked it with
birds from the family home in England. There
they had been ever since. Sometimes they were
carefully bred; sometimes they were neglected;
but always they were there, flying, cooing, nesting
in the quiet old country place.</p>

<p>As a boy, Black Mayo took great interest in
raising and training them. And this spring he
had sent to a famous breeder for new stock and
had begun again to train carrier pigeons.</p>

<p>He answered Mr. Blair with a smile and a nod,
and started out. “Hey, Dickon!” he said. “It’s
a long time since you came to see the pigeons.
Have you lost interest in them?”</p>

<p>“No; no, sir,” answered Dick, looking embarrassed.
“I—I—that I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Richard is—h’m!—keeping bounds this
month,” Red Mayo said austerely. “He
diso——”</p>

<p>“I understand.” Black Mayo spared Dick a
public explanation. “Well, come when you can.
I’ll bring you one of my young birds to-morrow,
to turn loose for a trial flight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Cousin Mayo!”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith sidled to the door and looked after
Mr. Osborne, with a malignant scowl.</p>

<p>“He, the one you call ‘Black Mayo,’ is—isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
he queer?” he said to Jake Andrews and Mac
Hight, who were sitting on the porch.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Jake Andrews.</p>

<p>“He takes up for the Germans; says they are
such good, kind people and he loves them. It
sounds to me strange to hear a man call himself
now a friend of the German peoples.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! Black Mayo ain’t said that; is he,
Mr. Tavis?” Jake appealed to the old man who
now came shuffling out on the porch.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did,” said Mr. Tavis. “He explained
at it somehow; but he certainly said he loved them
Germans that are tearing the world to pieces over
yonder.”</p>

<p>“And here, too,” said Jake. “Ain’t they been
blowing up railroad bridges, and factories, and
public buildings? Why, they’ve got soldiers
guarding the warehouses at South City; near us
as that!”</p>

<p>“That’s what South City gets for being on the
railroad where all sorts of folks go traipsing
up and down,” said Mr. Tavis. “I stand to what
I’ve always said, I’m glad the railroad don’t come
a-nigh The Village.”</p>

<p>“It’s good that Mr. Osborne so talks here
where you permit him what he pleases to say,”
said Mr. Smith. “In New York State a man for
that talk would be arrested and punished.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Shucks!” said Mr. Tavis. “Black Mayo
didn’t mean no harm. He always had a funny
way of talking.”</p>

<p>“You heard him say he loves the Germans; not
so?” insisted Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>“Well, yes; he certainly said that,” admitted
Mr. Tavis again.</p>

<p>“H-m-m! That’s mighty curious talk,” said
Jake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning the young folks gathered
at Broad Acres. All the school
children were there except Albert Smith
and Dick Osborne; and Dick, poor boy, was toiling
sullenly and alone in the garden at home.</p>

<p>The young war gardeners became so interested
in the task they had set themselves that they returned
to it in the afternoon, and there Black
Mayo found them when he came to bring Mrs.
Wilson some tomato plants.</p>

<p>“What is this, Agnes? a Chatterbox Club?”
he inquired, setting a basket carefully in a shaded
place. “From the noise I heard at a distance, I
thought crows or blue jays might be holding a
caucus in your garden.”</p>

<p>The young folks were duly indignant at the
slander, and asserted that their hands—most of
them, anyway, and—well, most of the time—were
going as fast as their tongues.</p>

<p>“Come and see what we are doing,” invited
Patsy. “Here are our potatoes; we are giving
half of our garden to them. Isn’t the soil fine,
and aren’t the rows pretty and even? Cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
Agnes showed us how to lay them off, by a string
tied to sticks at the ends of the row.”</p>

<p>“I wish the potatoes would hurry and come
up,” said Sweet William, “so I can get the bugs
off them.”</p>

<p>“Hey, old scout!” said Black Mayo. “Are you
in it, too?”</p>

<p>“Course I am,” was the complacent answer.
“I was the first to join. Wasn’t I, Cousin Agnes?
I reckon I’ve walked ten miles—well, I know I’ve
walked a mile—to-day, carrying buckets of potatoes
to the children to plant. Didn’t I, Cousin
Agnes?”</p>

<p>“You’ve been helping, dear. We couldn’t get
on without you. Nothing in The Village could
get on without our Sweet William,” said Mrs.
Wilson, kissing him.</p>

<p>He accepted the caress soberly and then said
with a little frown: “I reckon I’m ’most too big
for ladies to kiss.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Billy boy, you’ll change your mind in a
few years,” laughed Black Mayo. “What’s that
bag-of-bonesy thing at your heels?”</p>

<p>“He’s my dog; he’s Scalawag,” the youngster
explained with dignity.</p>

<p>“A dog, eh? A poor excuse for a dog!
Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get him. He came and adopted me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
explained Sweet William. “He’s a mighty good
dog. See! He’s watching me like he wants to
help.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Mayo, look at the bean rows I am
laying off,” called Patsy.</p>

<p>“Really and truly, Cousin Mayo,” said Anne,
“don’t you think it’s good for us to have a garden?”</p>

<p>“Truly and really, my dear,” he said, “I think
it’s splendid. You are helping—and how much
the willing, diligent children all over the land
can help!—in America’s work of saving the
world from starving. The fighters can’t farm,
so we must feed the armies; and we have the
people of France and Belgium on our hearts and
hands; and there are the U-boats—we must have
food enough to send another shipload for every
one they sink. It’s a big job.”</p>

<p>“We gardeners will do our part. I’m going
to help when I come back in June,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“She’s helping while she’s away, Cousin
Mayo,” said Patsy. “She suggested our having
a garden. And her Happy Acres, all except the
flower part, is to be put in corn. Our Canning
Club is going to can corn and butterbeans and
tomatoes together, to make Brunswick stew.
Cousin Agnes says we can surely sell all we
put up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“The girls think pie of their old Canning
Club,” said David, jealously. “We boys are
doing real work in our Corn Club, and we are
going to have a real garden; not dawdle around,
like a parcel of girls.”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” chided Mr. Osborne. “You
are working for the same cause. You are in
friendly camps, not hostile ones. By the way,
what are their names?”</p>

<p>“Names? They haven’t any,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! They must have names; of course
they must. Camp Feed Friend, isn’t that a good
name for yours, Patsy? And the boys’ plot can
be Camp Fight Foe.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said David; then he laughed.
“Maybe the girls will raise enough to feed Friend
Humming Bird!”</p>

<p>“Here, my boy!” said Mr. Osborne. “It isn’t
a sign of wisdom or experience to be scornful
of girls and women. You may do better work
than the girls; and then again you may not.
Time will prove. Suppose you keep a record of
your work and have a competitive exhibition of
garden products this autumn. I’ll give a prize,
the silver cup I cut my teeth on, to the best
gardeners.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Steve. “That cup is as good as
ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“‘There’s many a slip</div>
<div class="verse">’Twixt cup and lip,’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Patsy reminded him, with a saucy tilt of her chin.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne laughed. “Well, while I loaf
here, my work’s getting no forwarder. I must
go home. By the way, Agnes, I have two or
three bushels of potatoes for you that I’ll
send——”</p>

<p>“But, Mayo, you can’t spare——”</p>

<p>“Neither could you,” he said, looking at the
war-garden rows. “G’by! Oh, I was forgetting
the pigeon I brought Dick.” He picked up his
basket. “Poor hungry bird!”</p>

<p>“Hungry? Let me feed it,” said Mrs. Wilson.
“Here are a few peas left in my seed box.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no, thank you,” he answered. “It is
a racing pigeon that I’m beginning to train. It
must start off hungry, so it will fly home to be
fed.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it, Cousin Mayo; please let me
take it in my hands,” said Anne. She cuddled
the dove against her cheek. “What a pretty,
gentle bird it is! The emblem of peace, isn’t it?
Oh, what a shame it seems to send it from this
quiet, sweet place to those terrible battlefields!”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne put one caressing hand on the
bird and the other on Anne’s head.</p>

<p>“These God’s dear creatures bear messages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
of help and rescue through the battle cloud; they
soar above and beyond it, and their wings catch
the eternal sunshine. Ah! our doves of war are
still—are more than ever—the birds of peace.
For this war isn’t just a fight for territory and
undisturbed sea ways; it is a war for freedom
and human rights, and so for true and lasting
peace. Agnes,” he turned to Mrs. Wilson, “have
you given our young folks the President’s message?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” he repeated reproachfully. “And
already it is being read in French schools. It is
a part of the history of our times, of all time; it’s
like the Declaration of Independence, but wider,
higher, grander.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to read it to my history class,” said
Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>“To every one of these young folks, from
primer babies up, and now,” Black Mayo said
impetuously. “Get the paper. Let’s sit in the
summerhouse here and fancy it’s the Capitol and
this is the history-making night of April 2d.</p>

<p>“Here we are, waiting for the President.
He’s coming. The throngs on the streets are
cheering him at every step. The floor of the
House is crowded,—its own members, senators,
Cabinet officers, judges of the Supreme Court,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
representatives of the Allied nations. The galleries,
too, are crowded; people waited at the
doors for hours for the precious privilege of a
seat.</p>

<p>“The President rises, solemn and resolute with
a great duty. He stands there before the House,
before the world for all time. He is America
speaking. He gives the message that devotes a
hundred million people to war for American
rights and world freedom.</p>

<p>“It is done. He turns to go. And now, ah!
now statesmen are not Democrats, not Republicans;
they are only patriots. Men who have
stood with the President, men who have stood
against him, throng shoulder to shoulder to clasp
his hand and pledge themselves to support him
in this sacred cause. Only the ‘little group of
willful men’ stands shamefully apart.</p>

<p>“Here are the words that expressed and inspired
the soul of America.”</p>

<p>And then Mayo Osborne read the President’s
war message.</p>

<p>“‘The wrongs against which we now array
ourselves are no common wrongs; they cut to the
very roots of human life....</p>

<p>“‘We are at the beginning of an age in which
it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct
and of responsibility for wrong done shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
be observed among nations and their governments
that are observed among the individual
citizens of civilized states....</p>

<p>“‘The world must be made safe for democracy.
Its peace must be planted upon the tested
foundations of political liberty. We have no
selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquests,
no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves,
no material compensation for the sacrifices
we shall freely make....</p>

<p>“‘The right is more precious than peace,
and we shall fight for the things which we have
always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy,
for the right of those who submit to
authority to have a voice in their own governments,
for the rights and liberties of small
nations, for a universal dominion of right by such
a concert of free people as shall bring peace and
safety to all nations and make the world itself
at last free.</p>

<p>“‘To such a task we can dedicate our lives and
our fortunes, everything that we are and everything
that we have, with the pride of those who
know that the day has come when America is
privileged to spend her blood and her might for
the principles that gave her birth and happiness
and the peace which she has treasured.</p>

<p>“‘God helping her, she can do no other.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>There was a minute of silence at the end.</p>

<p>With eyes shining through tears, Mrs. Wilson
turned to her daughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth, Ruth!” she said. “If only you
were a boy in khaki, and I at your side!”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! I w-w-wish I were!” cried
Ruth.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful!” Black Mayo tapped the
paper with a thoughtful finger. “He Americanizes
the war, and does it by putting aside
everything for which the ‘land of dollars’ is supposed
to stand and upholding our old high ideals.
No indemnity, no conquests. The <i>Lusitania</i> was
an insult to our flag; more than that, it was a
dishonor to humanity.”</p>

<p>“He starts us on a high-going road,” said Mrs.
Wilson.</p>

<p>“Please,” broke in David, “let’s finish planting
our corn before dark.”</p>

<p>“Righto, boy!” exclaimed Black Mayo, jumping
up. “And my plow’s standing still. Geminy!
how time flies!”</p>

<p>He hurried away and the war gardeners went
back to work.</p>

<p>“Will you look who’s coming?” Patsy exclaimed
presently, glancing toward the gate.
“Jeff Spencer and Will Eppes!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson hastened to meet the visitors who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
had been her pupils from A B C days till they
went to university and engineering corps.</p>

<p>“Why, Jeff! I didn’t know you were at home!”
she said, shaking hands with the boy in front, a
pleasant-looking, round-faced fellow, so fat that
he resembled a well-stuffed pincushion.</p>

<p>“I—I am not at the University any longer,
Miss Agnes,” he said soberly.</p>

<p>“Not at the University!” She looked at him in
dismay. He had always been a mischievous
chap, and she had had her doubts and fears about
his college course, but gradually these had subsided.
Now he was in his senior year; and here
he was back home. What scrape had he got into?</p>

<p>Jeff’s light-blue eyes were twinkling, and now
he laughed till his fair, freckled face reddened
to the roots of his sandy hair.</p>

<p>“I always could get a rise out of you, Miss
Agnes!” he said. “Here you are wondering
what I’ve done to get sent away from the University,
just as mother did. And it never occurred
to you that I’ve left of my own free will.”
A new light came into the bright eyes. “I’ve
enlisted. And, gee! won’t a uniform be full of
me!”</p>

<p>“Enlisted!” she echoed. “But, Jeff, your
mother—she always said she could never consent
to——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>“Oh, she’s a trump, the ace of trumps! Of
course she hates war. The War took so many
of her people—her father and both her uncles—and
all the things. She knows what war is. But
when I put it up to her, she said ‘Go!’ Of course
I’d have had to do it anyway. I couldn’t look
myself in the face in a mirror if I sat safe at
home and let others risk their lives to make the
world a decent place for me to live in. So
I’ve come to say good-by to you who”—he
returned to his waggish tone—“put me up to
going.”</p>

<p>“I?” She was amazed. “Why, Jeff, I’ve not
seen you even to say ‘how-dye-do’ since war was
declared.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wasn’t thinking about lately. It was
the way you taught us history; not Jack’s book
that was so dry every time we turned a page it
raised dust, but in spite of it you made us know
what America stands for, the things for which
a man ought to be willing and glad to risk his
life. Grandmother says”—he grinned—“I’m
fighting for Confederate principles, the right of
self-government. Isn’t she a darling, red-hot old
Southerner?”</p>

<p>“And I’m going, too, Cousin Agnes,” said
William Eppes. “I didn’t know it till yesterday;
but father knew it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>“Your father knew it?” she repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes’m. He’d been might quiet lately, and
at last he came out with, ‘there never had been
an American war without an Eppes in it, and
here are the two of us, and I can take my choice;
but he hoped I’d stay at home and let him go,
being a Spanish-American vet.’ I asked him if
he knew what a whopper he was telling. Why,
he’d have dropped in his tracks if I had showed
the white feather and said I wasn’t willing to go.
But I just hadn’t thought of it. It didn’t take
me two secs to decide. Of course I’m going.”</p>

<p>“And so you boys are joining the army; going
to France to fight.”</p>

<p>It seemed but yesterday since they were little
fellows in her primer class. And now they were
going, with the bodies and hearts of men, to do
men’s work in the world. Through the mist in
her eyes she had a vision: New pages of the history
book opened, heroes walked out, took form
and life; lo! they were her own schoolboys—shy
Fayett Mallett, mischievous Jeff Spencer, slow
William Eppes—and others, others would
come. Why, here were the youngsters, even
little Sweet William, putting aside play to do
their part.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! goody!” Sweet William was saying
now, in his high, eager little voice. “We’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
got soldiers, our own soldiers, to send things to.
Come on, Jeff; you and Will, look at our gardens.”</p>

<p>And then half a dozen, talking at once, explained
about Camp Fight Foe and Camp Feed
Friend.</p>

<p>“I’m surely glad to see these gardens,” said
Jeff. “I always was a hearty eater, and my
‘stomach for fighting’ needs to be a full one.
We’re going to claim the best food we see over
there, aren’t we, Bill? biggest potatoes and
sweetest beans, for I know they’ll come from The
Village straight to us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll think of you when the weather gets
warm, and we’ll work hard and not loaf on the
job,” said Alice Blair.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said William. “It seems a
shame for you to tan your face and blister your
hands—for us.”</p>

<p>“I like to do it—for you,” said Alice; and then
she blushed.</p>

<p>“I should think you’d be going to Fort Myer,
Jeff,” said David.</p>

<p>“Well, I did think about the O. T. C.,” answered
Jeff; “but I felt sorry for those poor
officers. It seemed to me they need a few privates
under them; so I decided to be in the ranks. And
I’m going to try to get with Northern boys.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Jeff Spencer! Why——”</p>

<p>“So I can do missionary work,” he explained.
“Those Harvard chaps I met on our last game—bully
fellows they were!—thought the old United
States began in 1620 on Plymouth Rock. I broke
to ’em the news about 1607 and Jamestown,—that
before their <i>Mayflower</i> sailed, Virginia was
here, with a House of Burgesses standing for
freemen’s rights, just as we’re standing to-day.
Hurrah for Jamestown and Woodrow Wilson!”</p>

<p>The enthusiasm excited by the President’s
message and the volunteers extended to the
smallest small boys. For weeks they had been
carrying on a war play on their way home from
school. Now the game was blocked. The boys
who had composed the kaiser’s forces refused to
be Germans; they were Americans.</p>

<p>At last, after a whispered consultation with
Jeff Spencer, Joe Eppes said with a grin: “Oh,
wait a minute. I’ll be the Germans one more
time; I’ll be them all, kaiser and generals and
army.”</p>

<p>He ran home and soon came back, wearing a
German helmet made of an old derby hat with
a tin oil can fastened on top of it.</p>

<p>He did the goosestep backward down the hill,
shouting, “On! on! on! straight to Paris!” At
Tinkling Water, he swaggered on the foot log and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
tumbled, with a mighty splash, into the water, to
the huge delight of the other children who loudly
applauded the ignominious end of the German
forces.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE first Saturday afternoon in May
found a busy group of ladies and girls
in the big parlor at Broad Acres which
Mrs. Wilson had given up to Red Cross work.</p>

<p>Saturday was usually sacred to needle and
broom and cookstove, in preparation for the
quiet, strictly kept Presbyterian Sunday; but
to-day was an exception. A Red Cross box was
to be sent off next week, and everything else was
put aside to get it ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson was cutting out hospital shirts.</p>

<p>“This finishes our last piece of cloth,” she said
regretfully. “I do wish we had some money.”</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence. Money had to
be mentioned sometimes in a shop—asking Mr.
Blair the price of shoes and umbrellas, in an
apologetic tone. But to wish for it, in public and
aloud! No one had ever before heard a Village
lady do such a thing.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny Morrison, who had charge of the
work, broke the embarrassing silence. “These
shirts ain’t ready to pack,” she said with a frown,
as she pushed aside a bundle she had just opened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
“I’ve got to rip ’em and do ’em over. Every seam
is crooked or puckered.”</p>

<p>“If you would tell whoever did them——”
began Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p>“Course I can’t tell her,” said the seamstress,
who was supposed to have a tongue as sharp
as her needle. “It’s Mrs. Tavis. Ain’t she doing
her best, with her dim old eyes and trembly old
hands? I can’t tell her it would save me time for
her to sit and twirl her thumbs, and let me make
the shirts instead of unmaking ’em and making
’em over. Well, we’ve got a lot done. And you
girls have certainly worked splendid. I thought
you-all—Alice and Ruth and Patsy and Mary
Spencer and Essie Walthall, the bunch of you—would
just be a lot of trouble. But you’re faithful
and painstaking, and you do as good work
as anybody.”</p>

<p>“We like to do it,” said Patsy, whose fingers
were flying in the effort to finish a sweater.</p>

<p>“This will be six pairs of socks I’ve knit,” said
Alice Blair; “and I thought I’d never get done
that first pair!”</p>

<p>“You’ve learned how,” said her mother; then
she chuckled: “Will says he expects to wake up
some night and find me knitting in my sleep!”</p>

<p>“Ah, dears!” Mrs. Spencer said in her gentle,
quavering old voice. “This takes me back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
The War. We used to gather here, in this very
room, to knit socks and make bandages and tear
linen sheets and underwear into lint for our poor,
dear, wounded soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Those awful days!” said Miss Fanny. “I
certainly am thankful we are not really in this
war; in it with our men and our homes.”</p>

<p>“I am beginning to feel,” Mrs. Wilson said
quietly, “that we <i>are</i> in it, and that this <i>is</i> our
war. There are Fayett and Jeff and William;
and the President’s war message; and now the
draft.”</p>

<p>“It’s awful to think they may make our boys
go to foreign parts to fight,” groaned Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to need much making,” remarked
Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>“Europe doesn’t seem so far off as it used to,”
said Mrs. Red Mayo Osborne, who had locked
herself out of the bookcase for a whole week.
“Who’d have thought, three years ago, we’d be
giving up our Saturday duties to make things to
send to France and Belgium?”</p>

<p>“Europe isn’t so far off,” Mrs. Wilson replied.
“The Germans gave us two object lessons last
year, to prove that—sending the <i>Deutschland</i>
and <i>U-53</i> to our very harbors. And next thing
we know, aircraft will cross the ocean.”</p>

<p>The others laughed at the idea of such a thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“Well, there are other nearnesses,” said Mrs.
Wilson. “The ties are tightening among English-speaking
people. Didn’t it thrill you to read
about the Stars and Stripes floating from the
highest tower of the Parliament buildings?—the
first time a foreign flag was ever displayed
there.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t care so much about that.” Miss
Fanny tossed up her chin; she prided herself on
being an “unreconstructed rebel” and kept a little
Confederate flag draped over a chromo of “Lee
and his generals.” “But,” she went on, “it did
give me a queer feeling to read about that great
service the English had in St. Paul’s, to celebrate
America’s joining in the war. They sang ‘O
God! our help in ages past,’ the very hymn we
were singing Sunday morning.”</p>

<p>“We people of the same tongue and blood, are
getting together,” said Mrs. Red Mayo.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything good anywhere outside
The Village” declared Mrs. Walthall. “When my
old man comes home and tells the cruel, wicked,
dreadful, terrible things”—Mrs. Walthall’s
language was broken out with adjectives like
smallpox—“Will Blair reads in his paper—you
feel as if the world was upside down and
something mean and awful might even happen
here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>This was such a wild flight of fancy that every
one laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, even during The War,” said Mrs.
Spencer, “The War that we were in, bodies of
all the men and hearts of all the women and
children, even that, my dears, didn’t come to The
Village, except the one raid from Sherman’s
army marching north that awful April.”</p>

<p>“I am glad we are shut up here in this safe,
quiet little corner,” said Mrs. Blair; “for, as Mrs.
Walthall says, terrible things are happening.
Not only factories and munition plants destroyed
in the North, but railroad bridges and trestles
right here in Virginia; a bridge near Norfolk, a
bridge that trains with troops and supplies and
munitions have to cross, was saturated with oil
and set afire, by foreigners and negroes.” Her
voice dropped.</p>

<p>“There is our bridge——” began Mrs. Walthall.</p>

<p>She was interrupted by a little indignant stir.
Mrs. Osborne said crisply, “That bridge is just
as safe as our own doorsteps.”</p>

<p>“They say,” Mrs. Walthall said, “that in New
York poison has been put in Red Cross bandages
and dressings. I declare, I feel like we ought
to inspect our things and keep them locked up.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Anna!” exclaimed Mrs. Red Mayo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
“Inspect things! And lock them up! Who ever
locks up anything in The Village? Why, we
never lock our outside doors, and in summer-time
they stand wide open every night.”</p>

<p>“Strange and curious and terrible things are
happening in other places,” said Mrs. Walthall.</p>

<p>“In other places,” Mrs. Osborne repeated,
dryly and emphatically.</p>

<p>The ladies were so absorbed in work and talk
that they did not hear the click of the front gate
and the stumbling and stamping of feet coming
up the steps.</p>

<p>Susan opened the parlor door. “There’s some
menfolks out here, Miss Agnes,” she said to her
mistress. “They say please’m they want to see
the Red Cross ladies.”</p>

<p>“To see me?” asked Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>“To see the Red Cross ladies; that’s what they
say, Miss Agnes.”</p>

<p>“Ask them to come in,” said Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny modestly hid a hospital shirt she
was ripping and began to knit a wristlet. Susan
opened the door and ushered in nine old men.
They were feeble and broken with years, years
not only of age but of poverty and many hardships.
They shuffled in, some on wooden legs,
some dragging paralyzed feet, some supporting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
rheumatic limbs with canes and crutches. There
were palsied arms and more than one empty
sleeve.</p>

<p>The old fellows came in panting and wheezing
from the exertion of climbing the steps. At the
door they took off their hats, baring bald pates
and straggling white locks, and stood in line.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson went forward swiftly and greeted
them with gracious courtesy, but they did not
respond as friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>“We came on an errand to you Red Cross
ladies,” Captain Anderson said formally. “We”—he
straightened his old shoulders—“are Confederate
veterans.”</p>

<p>At the words the ladies came to their feet, in
respect and homage.</p>

<p>“Confederate veterans!” Captain Anderson
repeated.</p>

<p>The bent, stiff forms stirred with a memory
rather than a reality of soldierly bearing; the
bleared, dim old eyes brightened.</p>

<p>Their spokesman went on in his thin, quavering
voice: “Ladies, fair flowers of Virginia
womanhood, we, the little remnant surviving of
the gallant defenders of our glorious Lost Cause,
greet you. By the noble generosity of The Village,
funds have been raised for us to attend
the Reunion at Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“It is a grand and glorious place to hold the
Reunion. We are glad and proud that—that our
old comrades are to meet there—in the capital
they threatened six times by their dauntless and
renowned valor, but the streets of which they
were never to tread in uniform and under
flag until now, after a half century of peace.
They are to camp in the very shadow of the
Capitol of our glorious and reunited country,
and their battle-shattered and death-thinned
ranks are to parade before the President and be
addressed by him—the first President since The
War born on the sacred soil of old Virginia, and
the greatest President since Washington. Three
cheers for President Wilson!”</p>

<p>They were given with a will by the thin,
cracked old voices.</p>

<p>“And—and——” stammered Captain Anderson.</p>

<p>“Gettysburg,” said old Mr. Tavis, in a stage
whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes. Gettysburg; Gettysburg. That comes
presently.” He mopped his brow with a bandanna
handkerchief. “A-ah! The President to
address us. Yes, yes! No more is needed to
make it a grand and perfect occasion. But more
is to be added. The veterans in gray and their
brethren in blue are to make a pilgrimage to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Gettysburg, that was the high-water mark of our
glorious and unsuccessful war; there is to be
erected a monument to our brave comrades, the
heroes that fell on that bloody field. I tell you,
ladies, we are as glad and proud of it all as if we
were going to that Reunion ourselves.”</p>

<p>“But you are going!” cried Patsy.</p>

<p>“And now here’s war again—we don’t count
that little skirmish with Spain—but now the
United States is in a real war, and South and
North and East and West are standing shoulder
to shoulder together.</p>

<p>“This isn’t like The War we fought, a decent
war of man against man on the earth God gave
them to fight over. This war—it’s like nothing
that ever was before in civilized times—robbing
and burning towns by the hundred, shooting
down unarmed people in gangs, killing men with
poisonous gases like you would so many rats,
sinking ships without giving folks a chance for
their lives, dropping bombs from airships on
homes and schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>“It makes our hearts sick for people to suffer
such things; and it makes our blood boil for people
to do them. So we’ve talked it over together,
we old Confeds, and we’re all of one mind. We
want to help the women and children and the
pieces of men left by this hellish fighting. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
here is the money, please, ma’am”—he held out a
purse to Mrs. Wilson—“that you-all so generously
raised to send us to the Reunion. We bring it
to you as our contribution to the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Patsy, “but you mustn’t miss it,
the grandest of all Reunions. You must go.”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“This is what Marse Robert would do, if he
was here to-day,” he said simply, looking up now
in his old age, as to a beacon, to the hero he had
adoringly followed in youth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson controlled her voice and spoke:
“We accept your offering; don’t we?” She
turned to her companions, and every head was
bowed. “We accept it in the noble spirit in which
it is given, a spirit worthy of your peerless leader.
And we thank you from our hearts, in the name
of suffering humanity, to whose service it is consecrated.”</p>

<p>“But for you to give up the Reunion, the Reunion
that you’ve looked forward to!” mourned
Miss Fanny.</p>

<p>The old men glanced at one another with a
sort of shy glee. Then Captain Anderson said:
“That isn’t all. We are going to volunteer!
They’re going to have that draft and raise soldiers.
Folks said at first they’d just need American
dollars and food and steel; but they’re calling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
for soldiers now. And I tell you they’ll need
American valor. As long as war is war, they’ll
want <i>men</i>. The young soldiers, the drafted boys,
will do their best. But we—well, we are going
to write to the President and tell him we are
ready to go, and we seasoned old soldiers will
show those youngsters what fighting is!”</p>

<p>While the old heroes were making their offering,
Dick Osborne was creeping along the edge
of a field near The Village, carrying in his arms
something bundled up in a newspaper. He
scrambled through the churchyard hedge and
crept into the woodshed at the back of the church.
Now that its winter uses were over, no one else
gave the shed a look or a thought, and Dick had
hidden here his mining tools and a bundle with
something white in it.</p>

<p>His garden task was off his hands at last, and
he had planned to spend to-day at the old mine;
but Patsy had watched him keenly all the morning,
and this afternoon David and Steve were at
work in a cornfield near the road. Usually it
would be easy enough to elude them, but not to-day,
burdened with the tools he had to carry. And
anyway, he had devised a plan to lend interest
and excitement to the long, weary way to the
mine. In order to carry out his plan and avoid
embarrassing questions, he had obtained permission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to spend the night with his cousin at the
mill.</p>

<p>Safe in the shed, he opened the package he had
been carrying so carefully and chuckled as he
looked at its contents. It was a cow’s skull!</p>

<p>“Uh, it’s a beauty!” he said, gazing admiringly
at the bleached and whitened old thing. “And
when I fix it——!”</p>

<p>He proceeded to “fix it” by pasting green tissue
paper over the eyeholes and fastening his flashlight
inside. Then he stood back and looked at it.
Ah, it was as fearful looking as he had hoped it
would be! He opened the other package and
took out a sheet which he smeared with phosphorus.
It was getting dark now; late enough,
Dick thought, for him to venture out. He fastened
the tools together with an old chain and
slung them over his shoulder; then he draped
the sheet around him and fastened the skull on his
head. He crept out of the shed, slipped around
the corner of the church, and looked up and down
the road.</p>

<p>The coast was clear, and he took the road to
Redville. For a mile he had it to himself. Then
he heard wheels and voices behind him. He
hesitated a minute, then prudently withdrew to
the wayside. It might be people who would accept
him as a ghost; or it might not. Ah! It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Mr. Spencer, trotting homeward from The Village,
with his son Joe. Dick crouched in the
bushes.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, pa,” said Joe. “There’s something
queer in those chinquapin bushes; something
white and light looking. Let’s see what
it is.”</p>

<p>“Shuh! It’s just Gordan Jones’s old white
cow,” replied Mr. Spencer. “We haven’t time to
stop. We’re late for supper already.”</p>

<p>When they were safely out of sight, Dick came
back to the highway and hurried along till he
came to the Old Plank Road and the Big Woods.
From here on, there were only a few negro
cabins, and he felt secure in his ghostly array.</p>

<p>Isham Baskerfield’s cabin was dark and seemingly
deserted, but the door of the next house
was open and from within came a bright light
and loud voices and laughter. Peter Jim Jones
was having a “frolic.” The guests were overflowing
on the porch, and the barking of dogs
and the squealing of children mingled with the
jovial voices of men and women.</p>

<p>As Dick stalked down the road toward the
cabin, a dog began to bark and then subsided into
a whine. One of the negroes on the porch looked
around and caught a glimpse of the white, tall
figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Wh-what’s dat?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“What’s what?”</p>

<p>Dick took a few steps forward, clanking and
rattling his chains, and stood still in an open
space, revealed and concealed by the light of a
fading young moon. His white drapery glimmered
and gleamed with pale phosphorescent
light, and the green eyes in the ghastly old skull
glared like a demon’s. He uttered a sepulchral
moan.</p>

<p>The negroes rushed pell-mell into the cabin,
tumbling over one another.</p>

<p>“A ha’nt! a ha’nt! a ha’nt!”</p>

<p>Dick’s moan broke into a laugh, but that came
to an abrupt end. For a dozen dogs ran to investigate
the strange appearance which, after
all, had a human scent. Dick in his flowing
drapery stood for a moment at a disadvantage.
But he jerked up the sheet and gave a kick that
sent one cur yelping away. And then he laid
about him so vigorously with his bundle of tools
that the dogs retreated, yelping and howling,
while their masters crouched indoors, shaking
with terror.</p>

<p>Mightily amused and pleased with himself,
Dick went on down the road. He passed the
hollow where Solomon Gabe’s cabin stood, and
came to Mine Creek. He paused to look at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
his gruesome image in the still, dark water.
Then he turned to follow the path to the
mine.</p>

<p>As he turned, he faced a pile of logs, the ruins
of the old blacksmith’s hut. It was in shadow
except for a ray of moonlight at one side. In
that streak of moonshine, there rose, as if the
earth had yawned and let forth a demon, a little,
dark, bowed figure with a black, evil face. It
was horribly contorted, the eyes wide and staring,
the lips writhing in terror.</p>

<p>For a minute Dick and the fiendlike figure
stood silent, face to face. Then the boy stepped
back. His foot caught on a root; he stumbled
and, with a wild gesture and an awful clanking
of chains, fell flat on the ground.</p>

<p>A screech quivered through the air, so sudden,
so wild and terrified that it seemed like a live,
tormented thing. The dark form crashed
through the bushes and was gone.</p>

<p>Dick recovered himself in a minute. He
scrambled to his feet and, clutching his drapery,
ran up the hill toward the old mine. He
hurriedly rid himself of his ghostly apparel, took
out his flashlight, and threw the skull and the
tools into the mine hole. Then, with the sheet
bundled under his arm, he sped homeward. As he
passed Peter Jim’s cabin, he heard fervent prayers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and pious groans; the “frolic” had been
turned into a prayer meeting.</p>

<p>Dick smiled ruefully. “I don’t reckon they
were much worse scared than I was,” he said to
himself. “What—who on earth could that have
been?”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT last and at last, school was out! Patsy,
free and merry as a bird, wrote a long
letter to Anne Lewis.</p>

<p>She begged Anne to hurry and come to The
Village. There were so many things to do!
Camp Feed Friend was getting on famously;
Anne would see it was better than the boys’ Camp
Fight Foe. Happy Acres was a bower of roses;
they would take their knitting to the summerhouse
every day. Anne remembered—of course
she remembered—Dick’s dare and double dare
about their following him and finding out what
he was doing? They must certainly do that. He
went off every few days, no one knew where.
David and Steve had tried to follow him, but
Dick led them a chase—like an old red fox,
Cousin Mayo said—for miles and miles, and then
back home. It was certainly a <i>secret</i>, and she
and Anne must find it out. And Patsy ended as
she began; begging Anne to hurry and come to
The Village.</p>

<p>It was such an important letter that Patsy took
it to the post office herself to put it into Mr. Blair’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
own hand, feeling that would make it go more
surely and safely than if she dropped it into the
letter box. She had to wait awhile, for he was
talking to Mr. Spencer who had come in just
before her.</p>

<p>“We missed you at church yesterday, Joe,”
said Mr. Blair. “What’s the matter? You look
seedy.”</p>

<p>“It’s malaria, I reckon,” Mr. Spencer said in
a weak, listless voice. “I stayed in bed yesterday,
but I don’t feel much better to-day.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to have got up,” said Mr.
Blair.</p>

<p>“I have to crawl around and do all the work I
can. Crop’s in the grass, Will. Give me two
plow points and half a dozen bolts; I must start
a plow to-morrow. And I ought to be a dozen
hoe hands at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you hire hands?”</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer shook his head. “I never saw
labor so scarce and unreliable. I counted on Jeff
to help work the crop after I put it in; now he’s
in the army, you know.”</p>

<p>“You need him mighty bad at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we must do without him; there’s
where he ought to be. Well, if I can’t get hands
to chop my cotton this week, I’ll have to plow it
up and sow peas or something that I can raise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
without hoe work. Cotton is like tobacco, a
‘gentleman crop’ that requires waiting on; it
won’t stand grass. My crop must be worked this
week, or it’s lost.”</p>

<p>Patsy went home, frowning to herself as she
thought how sick and worried Mr. Spencer
looked. At the dinner table that day, she told
about seeing him and what he had said about his
cotton.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” said Mrs. Osborne. “I hope
he can get hands. It would be a serious thing
for him to lose his crop.”</p>

<p>“I wish——” began Patsy.</p>

<p>“It would be a severe personal loss,” said Mr.
Osborne, “and these things are national calamities,
too; cotton is one of the sinews of war.”</p>

<p>“Sinews of war? What do you mean, Uncle
Mayo?” asked David.</p>

<p>“Cotton is one of the great essentials of war,”
explained Mr. Osborne. “Its fiber is used for
tents and soldiers’ uniforms and airplane wings
and automobile tires; its seed supplies food
products; and fiber and seed are used in making
the high explosives of modern warfare—guncotton,
nitroglycerin, cordite. Cotton is one of the
great essentials of war.”</p>

<p>“What a lot of things it’s good for!” exclaimed
Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Patsy spoke again, and this time she did not
say “I wish.” Instead, she said: “I know we
could help Mr. Spencer, and the war. Mother,
father, please let us do it. I’m sure Ruth and
Alice and the other girls will help; and maybe the
boys. We can work rows of cotton as well as
rows of beans.”</p>

<p>Dick laughed. “H’m! I was just thinking
we boys might get together and help Mr. Spencer.
But you girls!”</p>

<p>“If we all help, the twenty of us, it’ll not take
long to chop over Mr. Spencer’s cotton,” said
David. He was more respectful of girls’ work,
since he was seeing their flourishing garden.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Patsy, clapping her hands.</p>

<p>“My dear!” exclaimed Mrs. Osborne. “You
don’t mean, Patsy,—are you suggesting that you
girls work a crop, like common field hands?”</p>

<p>“They’re very uncommon nowadays,” laughed
Patsy. “That’s why Mr. Spencer’s cotton is in
the grass. Oh, mother dear! he’s so sick and
miserable looking! We would love to save his
crop, and we can, if you’ll let us. You heard
what father said. It will be patriotic as well as
neighborly; with Jeff in the army, too! It’ll not
be a bit harder than gardening. Do say we may,
mother.”</p>

<p>Finally it was agreed that the young folks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
might undertake the task. As Patsy said, if they
could work rows of vegetables in a garden, they
could work rows of cotton in a field. They
would use light hoes, and the soil was sandy and
easy to work. But it was a big job to undertake,
those acres and acres of cotton!</p>

<p>Patsy and Dick and David went to see all the
members of Camps Feed Friend and Fight Foe,
to enlist them in the little army of crop savers.
They were easily persuaded. It was harder to
win over their parents. The Malletts and Walthalls
and Joneses were unwilling to let their girls
“do field work like niggers,” but they consented
when they learned that Alice Blair and Ruth Wilson
and Patsy Osborne were in the party; whatever
the Blairs and Wilsons and Osbornes did
was right and proper.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, the volunteer workers,
with hoes on their shoulders, presented themselves
to Mr. Spencer.</p>

<p>“Why—why,” he stammered, “it’s awfully
kind of you. But I can’t let you do it, you girls,
you young ladies! If the boys will help chop my
cotton, and let me pay them——”</p>

<p>“Come on, Mr. Spencer, and do your talking
while we work,” laughed Patsy. “Come on!
You may be our overseer and boss the job.”</p>

<p>Before the morning was half over, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
they deposed him. Why, he wanted them to stop
and rest every few minutes; at that rate, it would
be cotton-picking time before they finished chopping
the crop! So they elected David foreman.</p>

<p>Sweet William, as water boy, trotted back and
forth to supply cool drinks; and about the middle
of the forenoon, he proudly invited the workers
to a surprise luncheon, where each had half a
dozen delicious little wild strawberries on a sycamore-leaf
plate.</p>

<p>At noon they rested and ate their picnic dinner
in the grove at the spring. Evening found them
healthily and happily tired, and they went gladly
back to work the next day. Thursday brought
showers that gave them a rest and made the
freshly worked crop grow like magic. By noon
on Saturday, they finished hoeing the cotton and,
for the time at least, the crop was saved.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoon, the young workpeople
loafed like real farmers; for, according to rural
custom, that day was a sort of secular Sabbath
on which the men of the community rested from
all their labors and gathered sociably in the post
office or on Court-house Green.</p>

<p>What wonderful things they had to talk about
these days!</p>

<p>Mr. Blair read the account in his daily paper
of the Confederate Reunion at Washington and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
the President’s Arlington speech. The old soldiers
chuckled at hearing that foreigners, seeing
the Stars and Bars displayed alongside the Allies’
flags, asked wonderingly, “What flag is that?
What new nation has entered the war?”
They straightened their stooped old shoulders
at the description of their ten thousand comrades,
in gray suits and broad hats, marching along the
Avenue. And they said, with a sigh, that the
story was as good—almost—as being there.</p>

<p>Then they rehearsed tales of their battles and
marches and sieges, and compared old feats with
new.</p>

<p>Those brilliant Canadian drives were like Jackson’s
charges. And like one of his messages was
Foch’s telegram to Joffre in the battle of the
Marne: “The enemy is attacking my flank; my
rear is threatened; I am, therefore, attacking in
front.”</p>

<p>The heroic, hopeless, glorious Gallipoli campaign—ah!
it was the epitome of their War of
Secession. As long as the world honors high
courage and stanch devotion to a desperate cause,
it will remember those men who, like the Franks
in the old story of Roland, beat off army after
army and died, defeated by their own victories,
“triumphing over disaster and death.”</p>

<p>And the trench warfare——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“They learned that from us,” chuckled old
Captain Anderson; “and iron ships. Ah! we
showed the world a thing or two.”</p>

<p>But never had they dreamed of trenches like
these—stretching in long lines from the Swiss
mountains to the Belgian coast, bent in and out
by great attacks like the British at Neuve-Chapelle,
the Germans at Verdun, and both sides
in the bloody battle of the Somme.</p>

<p>And there were strange, new modes of warfare—U-boats
hiding underseas, aircraft battling
miles above the earth, tanks pushing forward
and cutting barbed wire like twine.</p>

<p>There were many things besides fighting to
discuss.</p>

<p>America was making vast and speedy preparation
for its part in the World War.</p>

<p>Two weeks after war was declared, Congress
without a dissenting voice voted the largest war
credit in the history of the world. And there was
a two-billion-dollar issue of Liberty Bonds. The
government must be trying to gather up all the
money in the United States, so as to have enough
to carry on the war many years, so these country
people said, little dreaming of the billions and billions
to be raised during the next two years.</p>

<p>There was the draft, too, to discuss. The Selective
Conscription Bill had passed. “They”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
were having men from the ages of twenty-one
to thirty registered, and “they” were to pick and
choose soldiers from these registered men. It
was wonderful how calmly this supreme assertion
of the government’s power was accepted.
There was a little opposition here and there—in
the Virginia mountains, in Kansas and Ohio,
in New York City—but all plots were promptly
and firmly quelled.</p>

<p>The Draft Act was accepted quietly by The
Village. It had its sentimental, passionate devotion
to the past; but now that it was being
tested, it realized the living, sacred strength of
the ties that bound it to the Union.</p>

<p>It heard, with even more horror than of things
“over there,” of outrages at home—the German
plot to get Mexico to declare war against the
United States, factories blown up, railroad
bridges destroyed, food poisoned; even here in
Virginia, things were happening. “They” said
loyal citizens everywhere ought to be on the lookout.</p>

<p>“There’s one safe place in the world; that’s The
Village,” said old Mr. Tavis, who was sitting on
the post office porch with Pete Walthall and Jake
Andrews and Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith shook his head and smiled. “See
who comes there,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“It’s Black Mayo,” Mr. Tavis said in a constrained
tone.</p>

<p>Somehow, no one understood how or why,
there had grown up a feeling of constraint about
Black Mayo whenever Mr. Smith was present.</p>

<p>“He’s got a basket,” commented Jake Andrews,
“and I bet there are pigeons in it. Yes, Mr.
Smith, it does look foolish for a grown-up man
to be raising birds and carrying them about and
playing with them.”</p>

<p>Dick Osborne, who came out of the post office
just then, spoke up indignantly. “Why, Mr. Andrews!
Cousin Mayo’s training those pigeons
for war; they use them to carry messages.”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” Jake laughed deridingly.</p>

<p>“Well, they can fetch and carry, you know,”
old Mr. Tavis said mildly. “It’s in the Bible;
Noah sent a dove out of the Ark and it came
to him in the evening with an olive leaf pluckt
off.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right—in the Bible,” said Jake.
“But we’re talking ’bout our days. My daddy
was in The War; I never heard him tell of using
pigeons. You were in The War yourself, Mr.
Tavis. I ask you, is you ever sent your news by
a pigeon?”</p>

<p>Mr. Tavis had to confess that he never did.</p>

<p>“And Black Mayo says they can fly a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
miles. Did you ever see a pigeon fly a thousand
miles, Mr. Tavis?”</p>

<p>“I never went a thousand miles myself,” Mr.
Tavis answered.</p>

<p>“I never did neither,” said Jake; “and I don’t
believe no pigeon ever did.”</p>

<p>Black Mayo now came up the porch steps,
greeting his neighbors cordially.</p>

<p>“Hope your ‘rheumatiz’ is better, Mr. Tavis.
Hey, Pete! Jake! How are folks at home?
and your crops? Ah, Dick! You are the boy I
was looking for. Here is the pigeon—a fine
fellow he is—that I want you to take this afternoon
for a three- or four-mile flight.”</p>

<p>“Good! I was just starting,” said Dick.
“What are you going to do with that other bird,
Cousin Mayo?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to send it to Richmond.”</p>

<p>“To Richmond! What for?” asked Jake Andrews.</p>

<p>“To be set free there and fly back here, as a
part of its training.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Mayo——” began Dick.</p>

<p>But Pete Walthall interrupted. “To fly back
here? You think it’ll come all that ways?” He
laughed incredulously.</p>

<p>“A hundred miles!” It was Black Mayo’s turn
to laugh. “He’ll make it in two or three hours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Why, man, I have had birds fly nine hundred
miles, and they have been known to go eighteen
hundred, flying over forty miles an hour.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” Jake Andrews whistled his unbelief,
and Pete Walthall stared and laughed.</p>

<p>“That beats the dove in the Ark,” Mr. Tavis
said doubtingly.</p>

<p>Dick now got in his question. “Cousin Mayo,
aren’t carrier pigeons useful in war?”</p>

<p>“Certainly and indeed they are,” Mr. Osborne
answered. Then, as Mr. Tavis still looked doubtful,
he gave an instance. “At Verdun a company
of Allied troops was cut off from the main line,
and one man after another, who tried to go back
for help, was shot down. At last a basket of
pigeons was found beside a dead soldier. The
birds were weak, almost starved; but the men, as
a desperate last chance, started them off with
notes fastened to their legs. Off they flew,
through that curtain of fire no man could pass.
The message was delivered; forces came to rescue
the trapped soldiers—saved by those birds.”</p>

<p>Pete and Jake shook their heads incredulously.</p>

<p>Mr. Tavis pondered a while, and then said:
“Well, they could carry that note just as good
as that other dove could carry the olive leaf for
Noah. <i>I</i> am going to believe it, Mr. Mayo.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Black Mayo. “What’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
matter with you folks? Don’t you always believe
what I say? And why shouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>No one answered, and he went on into the post
office, looking a little puzzled.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith raised his eyebrows and glanced
around with a disagreeable smile. “Pe-cu-li-ar
amusement; pe-cu-li-ar statements; he himself is
pe-cu-li-ar.” The drawled-out word was unfriendly
and sinister.</p>

<p>“Black Mayo is all right; all right,” old Mr.
Tavis said emphatically.</p>

<p>But Pete and Jake dropped their eyes. Black
Mayo Osborne was a queer fellow. They had
known him all their lives. But did they really
know him? Why was he playing about with
birds, like a schoolboy, while other men were
working their corn and cotton and tobacco? They
looked askance at him as he came out of the
post office and went up The Street toward The
Roost.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Osborne sitting on the porch
with her eyes on a book propped on the railing
and her hands busily knitting a sweater.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Miranda! Where’s David?” he
asked.</p>

<p>She looked up with a start. “Oh! it’s you,
Mayo,” she said. “David isn’t here; he’s at his
corn acre, I suppose. But, Mayo, come in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
minute. There’s something I want to speak to
you about. It’s Dick,” she went on, as her cousin
took off his broad-brimmed straw hat and settled
himself on the porch step.</p>

<p>“What about Dick?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a minute. “The other young
folks are working splendidly in their war garden.”</p>

<p>“Yes; that was a good suggestion of Anne’s.
The food question is serious,” said Black Mayo.
“Did you ever know anything like the way the
price of wheat has climbed—and soared? Flour
is fifteen dollars a barrel, and it will go to twenty,
if the government doesn’t get those Food Bills
through Congress and take control. I hope it
will be a good crop year. The young folks are
doing a splendid work in their war gardens.”</p>

<p>“And Dick not in it,” said Dick’s mother,
frowning. “He goes off alone somewhere every
chance he gets. We’ve never interfered with
their little secrets; but this looks so selfish!
We’ve thought of compelling him to help,
but——”</p>

<p>“But you’ll not. This gardening is free-will
work.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mrs. Osborne agreed. “And we’ve
always taken the stand that after the children
do their regular home work, their spare time is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
their own. But, if Dick could be persuaded, influenced——”
She looked hopefully at Black
Mayo. “You can do anything with him,” she
said. “Your word is law and gospel to all the
Village young folks.”</p>

<p>“I refuse to be flattered into coercing Dick,”
laughed Black Mayo. “If you want him spoken
to, my dear Miranda, speak to him yourself.”
He leaned back against the porch post, stretched
out his long legs, and then twisted them comfortably
together. “Speak to your own erring
boy!”</p>

<p>“I have done it,” she said. “I tried to shame
him just now. I reminded him how David and
Patsy and even little Sweet William are working
to raise food for the hungry, suffering world.
I told him about the Richmond Boy Scouts who
are going on farms, to save the potato crop.”</p>

<p>“And he refused to be shamed?”</p>

<p>“He cocked up his head, with that superior,
self-satisfied air—oh, big as he is, I want to slap
him when he does that!—and said, ‘It’s a nice
little thing David and Patsy and the others are
doing—the best they can, I reckon. But I’d
rather do a big thing; something to get a lot of
money, enough to buy a whole Liberty Bond at
a whop.’ And before I could get my wits together
to answer that amazing foolishness, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
said he’d finished his tasks, hoed the beans, and
brought in stove wood, and couldn’t he go. And
off he went. What would you do, Mayo?”</p>

<p>“I think I’d do nothing, Miranda,” her cousin
replied. “A boy’s got to have his adventures.
And Dick’s a fellow that can stand a lot of letting
alone. If he’s on the wrong track, he’s got
sense enough to find it out and get on the right
one. Don’t worry, Miranda. Will you tell
David he can get one of my plows any day he
wants it? And don’t you worry about Dick,
Miranda,” he repeated, untwining his long legs
and getting up.</p>

<p>As he started down the walk, Mrs. Osborne put
aside her work and went out to the kitchen, a one-roomed
cabin behind the Roost dwelling-rooms,
to speak to Emma.</p>

<p>The old woman was standing at the door, looking
worried and grum.</p>

<p>“Why, Emma, you haven’t kindled your fire!”
Mrs. Osborne exclaimed.</p>

<p>Emma started. “Naw’m. My shoe sole was
floppin’. I had to go to de shop to git it sewed
on.”</p>

<p>“De shop” was a shed on The Back Way where
shoes were cobbled by Lincum Gabe, old Solomon
Gabe’s son.</p>

<p>“I’m gwine to start de fire now.” Emma’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
voice was mournful, and as she rattled the stove
lids, she shook her head and sighed dolefully.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter? Are you sick?” Mrs.
Osborne asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Naw’m, I ain’t sick, Miss M’randa. I don’t
reckon I is. I ain’t got no out’ard pains. I’m
just thinkin’ ’bout my boy, an’ wonderin’ who’ll
git him——” She went off into a confused
mumble. Suddenly she turned to her mistress
and said earnestly: “If dey take de colored folks
back in slavery, I’ll belong to you; won’t I, Miss
M’randa? Like my folks always did to yore
folks?”</p>

<p>“What nonsense are you talking, Emma?”
Mrs. Osborne asked sharply. “No one could
put you back in slavery. No one wants to. We
hate and abhor it more than you do. Why, we
wouldn’t have you back in slavery for anything in
the world. What put such a silly notion in your
head?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t faultin’ you ’bout it, Miss M’randa.
It’s dem folks off yander,” said Emma, vaguely.
“Dey done started it. Dey done numbered de
young bucks an’ dey’re goin’ to nomernate ’em
to be slaves. Dey’re just waitin’ for de orders.
My boy Tom is one of ’em.”</p>

<p>Patsy, who had followed her mother, laughed
and exclaimed: “Why Aunt Emma! They numbered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
all the men, white and colored, from
twenty-one to thirty years old, and they are going
to select soldiers from them, to go and fight the
Germans.”</p>

<p>“Emma, some due has told you a lie, a wicked,
silly lie,” said Mrs. Osborne. “There isn’t a
word of truth in it. As Patsy says, the white
boys are going, too. Why, some of them have
gone—Fayett Mallett and Jeff Spencer and Will
Eppes—boys that you know, and lots of others.
They need a great many soldiers, and they are
going to select them from that draft list.”</p>

<p>“Dey say as how dem white ones was took to
be offiseers, an’ boss de colored ones till dey git
’em handcuffed an’ back in slavery,” said Emma,
lowering her voice and glancing fearfully around
as if she were betraying secrets of state.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne laughed. “How silly! Who are
‘they’ that say such foolish things?”</p>

<p>“Uh, it’s jest bein’ talked ’round,” Emma answered
evasively.</p>

<p>“It sounds like propaganda,” said Mrs. Osborne,
wrinkling her brow.</p>

<p>“Naw’m, ’tain’t no sort o’ gander. It’s just
talk dat’s goin’ ’round. You-all want some
seconds batter-cakes, you say, honey?”</p>

<p>And Emma went bustling about her work, deaf
to all further questions.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“COME on, Sweet William! Sweet William!”
sang Patsy, catching her small
brother by the hand and dancing down
the walk. “Let’s go to Broad Acres for a look
around. Alice! uh, Alice!” She called Alice
Blair, who was sitting in the swing, with her
knitting. “Come and see how our gardens are
growing. We’ve been so busy being field hands
for Mr. Spencer’s cotton, I’ve not been to our
garden for two whole days.”</p>

<p>“I ran by to look at it this morning,” said
Alice. “I feel real lonesome if I don’t see it
every day.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Patsy. “I know now how
David felt that first year he had corn at Happy
Acres, and he used to ‘go by’ to see it every time
he was sent to the store for the mail or a spool of
thread.”</p>

<p>At the garden gate they paused and called
Ruth. She came out on the back porch, but
stopped at the head of the steps.</p>

<p>“I’ve j-just come in,” she said. “I weeded a
row of p-peas. Now I’m helping mother. I’ll
see you p-p-presently.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>The others went into the garden, admired
the flourishing vegetables, and pulled up a few
stray weeds.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it beautorious?” exclaimed Patsy.
“Things have just been leaping and bounding
along these two days.”</p>

<p>“Scrumptious!” agreed Alice.</p>

<p>“We-all boys have got the biggest potatoes,”
said Sweet William, wagging his head proudly.</p>

<p>“You-all boys! Will you look at those beans?
What about them, Mr. William Taliaferro Osborne?”
demanded Patsy. “Anne Lewis had a
lot to say about their Washington gardens. They
aren’t a bit better than this; they can’t be. Just
think! Anne is coming next week.”</p>

<p>“Goody, goody, goody!” cried Sweet William,
clapping his hands.</p>

<p>As they went chattering back up the walk, Ruth
came out to ask them to stay to supper; her
mother had a strawberry shortcake.</p>

<p>“I’ll go and ask——” “If mother knew——”
began Patsy and Alice.</p>

<p>“If I had a piece of strawberry shortcake in
my hand,” suggested Sweet William, “I could
go home and tell them you were invited. We are
going to have batter-cakes for supper; Emma
makes good little batter-cakes with lacy brown
edges.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Patsy was properly horrified at her small
brother’s greediness, but Mrs. Wilson laughed
and sent him home, munching a generous slice
of shortcake.</p>

<p>After supper Mrs. Wilson and the girls went
out on the front porch. It was wide and long,
set high on brick pillars, with a flight of steps
leading down to the long boxwood-bordered
walk.</p>

<p>“There is a loose railing,” said Mrs. Wilson.
“I must nail it in place to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You are as careful about mending and tending
Broad Acres as you are about Ruth’s darning
and patching,” laughed Patsy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilson. “It’s all in the
family. Broad Acres is a dear old part of the
family.”</p>

<p>“How old is it, Cousin Agnes?”</p>

<p>“The house was built in 1762,” said Mrs. Wilson,
with quiet pride. “It was made strong, to
be a fort, in case of Indian attacks. That is why
the shutters are so thick, with the little hinged
middle pieces for loopholes to fire from.”</p>

<p>“The Yankees came by here in The War,” said
Ruth.</p>

<p>“In April, ’65,” agreed her mother. “The
doors and shutters were closed, with crape hanging
from them, in mourning for the dead Confederacy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Sherman’s men marched past, without
disturbing the house, thinking there was a
corpse in it.”</p>

<p>“This very bench we’re s-s-sitting on is c-called
the President’s bench, because W-W-Washington
sat here when he was v-visiting my way-back-grandfather.
Tell about that, mother,”
said Ruth.</p>

<p>But an interruption came before Mrs. Wilson
could begin the story, the more loved because it
was old and well known. The front gate clicked.
Patsy glanced toward it and, seeing a negro girl
standing there, exclaimed in surprise, “Why,
there’s Lou Ellen!”</p>

<p>“Go to the side gate, Lou Ellen,” Mrs. Wilson
said sharply. “What do you mean by coming the
front way?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t comin’ in,” said Lou Ellen, in a pert,
high voice, as she lounged on the gate. “I jest
come to de store an’ stopped to leave you a message,
Miss Agnes. I was comin’ down de mill
path an’ a man—I reckon he was Van—hollered
to me an’ said Mr. Black Mayo say for you
please’m to go an’ spen’ de night wid Miss Polly.
He got to go ’way an’ she was feelin’ sort o’
puny, an’ he didn’t want to left her at home by
herse’f.”</p>

<p>“It’s strange he didn’t tell me when he was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
The Village to-day,” said Mrs. Wilson. “Van
told you, you say?”</p>

<p>“It sounded like Van,” answered Lou Ellen.
“He was in de woods an’ I didn’t see him good.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head and strolled away.</p>

<p>“She’s a horrid thing!” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“How could she help it?” asked Alice. “Her
mother, Louviny, is as trifling as she can be, and
so is her father, Lincum; and his father is
that horrid old Solomon Gabe that they call a
trick doctor; all the other darkies are afraid of
him.”</p>

<p>“Darkies are queer things,” laughed Patsy.
And then she told what Emma had said about the
draft.</p>

<p>“She isn’t the only one who believes that,” said
Alice. “Unc’ Isham told father he’d heard tell
they are all going to be put back in slavery; he
said they always told him if the Democrats got
strong in power, they would make the darkies
slaves again.”</p>

<p>“I wonder how they get these foolish notions
into their heads?” said Mrs. Wilson. “Well,
chickens, Ruth and I must be starting to Larkland.”</p>

<p>“Let Ruth spend the night with me, Cousin
Agnes,” entreated Patsy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson consented, and the three girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
walked with her as far as the mill on her way
to Larkland. Sweet William did not see them
go, and he was surprised to find the house dark
and deserted when he came running back, with
Scalawag at his heels, for his sweater. He went,
with a little feeling of awe, down the somber
boxwood walk—it was now nearly dark—and it
was a relief to hear Scalawag, who had run ahead
of him, give a sharp bark.</p>

<p>“Cats-s! cats-s!” hissed Sweet William
urgingly.</p>

<p>Scalawag ran to a rose arbor at the back of
the garden, but his furious barking changed
to a sudden yelp and whine; he ran back to his
master.</p>

<p>“Old tabby cat must have scratched you,” said
Sweet William. “Sic her! sic her, Scalawag!”</p>

<p>But the dog, bristling and growling, kept at his
master’s heels, as if unwilling to encounter again
whatever he had found in that dark, secluded
place. Sweet William groped around for his
sweater and ran home. Then he had his bath
and went to bed. The older children followed
soon, as behooved those who must be at Sunday
school at half past nine o’clock and know a Psalm
and the story of Gideon and be ready to answer
seven new questions in the Shorter Catechism.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the Osbornes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
at breakfast, Steve came running into the room,
with a tragic face.</p>

<p>“Our gardens are ruined!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Oh, Steve! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Ruined?”</p>

<p>“They can’t be!”</p>

<p>“Ruined!” he repeated, with doleful emphasis.
“I went by there, just after breakfast, taking our
cow to pasture. I saw the gate open——”</p>

<p>“Who left it open?” demanded David.</p>

<p>“And Miss Fanny Morrison’s old cow was
there, gorging herself on our corn and peas.
Everything is grazed off; trampled down.”</p>

<p>With no more appetites for breakfast, the war
gardeners ran to Broad Acres, to see the wreck
of their gardens.</p>

<p>“But who left the gate open?” David demanded
sternly.</p>

<p>“We were the last ones here,” said Patsy; “and
I know we shut it.”</p>

<p>“I was here about dark,” Sweet William confessed
bravely; “I came for my sweater. But
I shut the gate and I fastened it. I had to climb
up on the garden fence to put the hook in
the hole.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t put it in,” Patsy said severely.
“You let it slip to the side. And our gardens
are ruined.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“It’s my garden, too. And I did fasten the
gate,” sobbed Sweet William.</p>

<p>He seemed so clearly the culprit that black
looks and little pity were being given him when
Mrs. Wilson came up.</p>

<p>She, too, was horrified and distressed, but she
said: “If Sweet William is sure he fastened the
gate, I am sure he fastened it. There is something
strange about this matter. Mayo did not
send for me. He is away, but Polly had told him
she would have Chrissy sleep in the house. She
was surprised—but of course pleased—to see
me; I would have come back home, if it hadn’t
been so late.”</p>

<p>“Could Lou Ellen have done it?” suggested
Patsy. “She came with that message; and she’s
so pert and horrid.”</p>

<p>They examined the premises carefully. Near
the rose arbor, at the back of the garden, they
found footprints, the track of a big, bare, flat
foot. Dick carefully made a copy of it on a piece
of paper, and Mr. Blair and Mr. Red Mayo Osborne
went with the gardeners to Lincum’s cabin
on the Redville road, and confronted Lou Ellen.
She stoutly denied the charge, and when her foot
was measured it proved to be much smaller than
the print. Evidently, then, she was not the intruder.
Who could it be?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>That was a doleful Sabbath for the young villagers.
They were thinking more about their
wrecked garden than their Sunday school lesson;
the sermon fell on deaf ears; and in the afternoon
they stood mournfully around the scene of their
destroyed hopes.</p>

<p>But with the next morning came cheer and
good counsel. Black Mayo, having come back
on an early train, stopped at the post office and
was told about the catastrophe and he went to
view the garden.</p>

<p>“It is pretty bad, but it might be worse,” he
said cheerily. “Some of these things will come
up from the roots. Some of the rows will have
to be plowed up and planted in things that will
still have plenty of growing time. The soil is
in fine condition. Let’s get to work and make a
garden day of it. One of you boys go to Larkland,
and get Rosinante and a plow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Tavis came to help them, and so did Mr.
Blair, who shut up the post office, saying casually
that any one who came for mail could look him
up or wait till he got back.</p>

<p>Several hours of diligent, intelligent toil
worked wonders. The gardens would be later,
of course, but with a long growing season before
them that was no serious disadvantage; it would
require more work, much more work, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
they were all willing and glad to give. Why,
Dick had offered to help this morning, and he had
been just as interested and busy as any one else.
Perhaps he would join the garden club now. But
he did not. When Mr. Osborne went home to
dinner, Dick started off with him, to get a pigeon
for a trial flight.</p>

<p>Patsy looked after him and set her lips firmly.
“Just you wait, young man,” she promised him,
“till next week when Anne Lewis comes. We’ll
show you what it means to dare and double dare
us.”</p>

<p>For weeks Dick had been going off alone every
few days, and coming back late, tired and dirty
and with a joyful air of mystery. The others
were too busy with gardening and Red Cross
and Corn Club work to make any real effort to
find out where he went.</p>

<p>But he always watched to make sure that he
was not followed, and he never relaxed his precautions
at the mine. He pulled his ladder in and
out, blurred his footprints, and stirred up the
dead leaves so as not to make a path. It would
take, he proudly thought, a Sherlock Holmes or
a bloodhound to trace his course.</p>

<p>He had examined the main room without seeing
any place that it seemed worth while to work
in the crude fashion possible to him. The most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
promising places, he thought, were in the spurs
of the lower tunnel, where there was more clay
than rock. If he dug a little farther—a few
inches or some feet—perhaps he would find silver
that the miners had missed.</p>

<p>He planned to extend each spur a certain distance;
at first he said ten feet, but a little work
convinced him that was too far, so he decided to
go six feet—or five—or four. It was too discouraging
to compute how long it would take to
go even four feet, at his snail-like rate of progress.
He could not use alone the drill and sledge
hammer he had brought from Mr. Mallett’s shop.
So he had to content himself with digging along
a ledge, breaking off rough bits of rock and
eagerly examining them for silver.</p>

<p>He had inquired furtively about dynamite, but
the law made it difficult for him to get it—fortunately;
for in his ignorant, inexperienced
hands there would probably have been an accident
which might even have cost him his life.</p>

<p>On this pleasant June afternoon, Dick went
blithely with his Cousin Mayo to Larkland. He
nearly always went there on his way to the Old
Sterling Mine; it was only half a mile off the
road; and the distance to the mine seemed shorter
to him when he had a carrier pigeon for
company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Breeding and blood were telling in the Larkland
pigeons. Mr. Osborne showed Dick that
afternoon a marked copy of <i>The Bird World</i>
telling, with big headlines, about the thousand-mile
flight of a young pigeon trained by Mr.
Mayo Osborne, of Virginia.</p>

<p>“I bet Snapshot will make a record, too,” said
Dick, stroking the plumage of a petted young
bird.</p>

<p>“Dick,” said Mr. Osborne, suddenly, “I’m glad
to have your help and interest about these birds;
I want you to learn all you can about training
them. Your Cousin Polly knows all there is to
know about their feeding and care. But when I
go away——”</p>

<p>“Oh! you are going away?” interrupted Dick.
“When, Cousin Mayo?”</p>

<p>“Early this fall, I hope; as soon as some business
matters can be arranged. I’ve been wanting
to be in the army from the first.”</p>

<p>“I said you would go. It wasn’t true you
wanted to stay at home playing with birds.”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne looked at Dick and started to ask
a question, but it did not seem worth while. So
he merely said: “When I leave, I’m going to ask
your father to let you stay here at Larkland with
your Cousin Polly and help her with the doves,
our doves of war.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“Thank you, Cousin Mayo; I’ll do my best,”
promised Dick.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne wrote a note and fastened it to
the bird’s leg—that was always part of the ceremony;
then he put it into a makeshift cage, an
old shoe box with holes punched in it, and gave
it to Dick.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Mr. Osborne.</p>

<p>“To the mine—creek,” said Dick, almost telling
his secret. It was hard not to give a forthright
answer to his cousin’s direct look.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you boys—do you?—ever go to
the Old Sterling Mine?”</p>

<p>“Maybe so. Sometimes,” he mumbled.</p>

<p>Black Mayo did not notice the boy’s conscious
air. He was watching his pigeons fluttering
and circling about, white against the woodland,
dark against the shining sky.</p>

<p>“I used to go there;” he said. “Ah! the hours
and days I spent, seeking its treasure. It was
one of the great adventures of my boyhood.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever find any?—any silver in the
mine, I mean,” Dick asked eagerly.</p>

<p>His cousin gave a smiling negative.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose?—perhaps there isn’t any.”
Dick’s voice dropped in disappointment.</p>

<p>“I believe there is,” said Black Mayo. “Silver
was found there by old Mallett, not long after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
Revolution. You’ve heard the tale handed down
in his family. Some years ago, when I was rummaging
through old court records, I found the
account of his trial for ‘feloniously making,
uttering, and passing false and counterfeited
Coin in the likeness and similitude of Spanish
milled Dollars of the value of six shillings Current
money of Virginia.’ That was in 1792.”</p>

<p>“But the mine was worked after that, wasn’t
it?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! My grandfather Mayo, your great-grandfather,
had it worked, but it never paid. It
doesn’t seem reasonable that the old blacksmith
spaded out all the silver that was there. There’s
a tale that a valuable vein was struck and lost.
You might take a look around to-day, and you
and I might go prospecting some time,” he said,
now looking keenly at Dick.</p>

<p>The boy reddened to the roots of his hair.
“Yes, sir,” he said. “It’s time I was gone.”</p>

<p>Mayo Osborne looked after him with a whimsical
smile. “Straight to the Old Sterling Mine,
I’ll wager my head!” he laughed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ANNE LEWIS had come, and that was a
jubilee for her and her Village cousins.
She and Patsy and Alice and Ruth
wanted to go to every place at once and to tell in
one breath everything that had happened since
they had parted in the spring.</p>

<p>There was Happy Acres to be visited, and its
budding and blossoming beauty to be welcomed.
There was the mill, Larkland mill that was
loved almost as dearly as the miller, Mr. Giles
Spotswood. There were all the cousins at Larkland,
Broad Acres, and The Roost. And there
was the dear outside host, Tavises and Morrisons
and Walthalls, and the old servants and their
families, for whom Anne had gifts and greetings.
The girls made a round of visits, with their
tongues going like bell clappers.</p>

<p>“And haven’t you found out yet where Dick is
going—not yet?” Anne asked Patsy, privately.
“Oh, I’m so glad! It’ll be so much fun to follow
him up!”</p>

<p>“If we can. We’ll certainly do it, if we can,”
said Patsy, with less assurance. “Anne, even
Dick has never kept a secret like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>“I don’t see why you haven’t found out, in all
these weeks,” said Anne; “though I’m glad you
haven’t, so we can do it together.”</p>

<p>“Dick isn’t so easy to catch up with,” answered
Patsy. “And then there are our gardens.
The boys won’t stop working for fear we’ll get
ahead of them, and we won’t stop for fear they’ll
get ahead of us. No one has time—and time it
would take!—to follow Dick.”</p>

<p>“You must win out in the gardening; we must
certainly beat those boys,” said Anne. “I’m so
glad I’m here to help.”</p>

<p>They were on their way now to inspect Camp
Feed Friend and Camp Fight Foe, that were
thriving wonderfully after being replanted and
reworked ten days before. Black Mayo said
Jack’s famous beanstalk must surely have grown
in the deep, fertile soil of Broad Acres garden;
no other place could produce such magic results.</p>

<p>Patsy and Anne found most of the war gardeners
already at Broad Acres, at work. Black
Mayo had lent them Rosinante, and David was
plowing while the others were weeding and hoeing
the rows of vegetables. Anne and Patsy set
to work, side by side.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think our garden is the better?”
Patsy asked for the dozenth time.</p>

<p>And for the dozenth time, Anne—partial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
judge!—answered emphatically: “I certainly do.
Your potatoes are taller than theirs. And your
peas are better; I’ve counted the pods on the
biggest vines in both gardens. It’s just splendid
what you’ve done—all but Dick.”</p>

<p>“Oh!—Dick.” Whatever Patsy herself might
say about Dick, she could never bear to have
others find fault with her twin brother. “He
helps Cousin Agnes in her garden. He would
work here sometimes—real often—but the boys
call him ‘slacker’ because he won’t join them.
He’s working hard over his secret, whatever it
is. He comes home so dirty! And—well, Anne,
I know it’s something big, from the way he acts.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out what it is,” Anne said confidently.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” sighed Patsy.</p>

<p>“But now,” said Anne, “this garden is the
most important thing. Oh! it’s awful to think of
all those people with nothing to eat except what
we send them across these thousands of miles of
ocean.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been saving our flour and sugar for a
long, long time; looks like they might have
enough to eat now,” Sweet William said, frowning.
“Oh! I did want them all to have enough,
and leave me sugar for a birthday cake. It’s such
a so-long time since I’ve seen a real cake!” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
sighed. “I don’t reckon we’ll ever have another
one; not till I get old as Miss Fanny Morrison
and don’t have any birthdays.”</p>

<p>“Father says conditions are terrible along the
Hindenburg Line,” said Alice. “Cousin Mayo,
what is the Hindenburg Line?” she asked her
cousin who, having finished some errands in The
Village, was waiting to take Rosinante home.</p>

<p>He explained. “The first of this year, the Germans
realized that they could not repel Allied
attacks in the position they then held. So in
March they drew back and entrenched themselves
in northern France in a position as strong
as the nature of the country and their science
could make it; that is their ‘impregnable Hindenburg
Line.’ The Allies began, with the battle
of the Aisne in April, the attacks they will continue
till that great Hindenburg Line is smashed.</p>

<p>“Well! The Huns laid waste the country that
they left; robbed and burned homes and villages
in that rich farming country, and kidnapped men
and women and children and set them to work in
Germany. And they left behind wrecks of people
in wrecks of homes, many of them little fellows
like Sweet William here, half starved and
crippled and shell-shocked.”</p>

<p>Anne put a comforting arm around Sweet William.
“Don’t cry, dear,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>He stiffened his lips bravely. “I—I’m not
crying,” he announced. “I—I think I caught a
cold. I’ve got a frog in my throat. I wish I
could find a lot of potato bugs! I want to work
<i>hard</i> to help all those poor people.”</p>

<p>He set to work very diligently, but presently
David called out: “You Bill! You’re wearing out
those potato plants, looking for the bugs you
caught yesterday. And every row I plow, you’re
in my way.”</p>

<p>“I isn’t not moved since I got out your way the
other time you told me to,” complained Sweet
William, stumbling over a furrow.</p>

<p>“Well, get out of the patch and stay out till I
finish this plowing, if you please,” said David,
who was warm and tired and getting cross.</p>

<p>The little fellow turned away with injured
dignity and went into the back yard. He sat on
the porch steps for a while, then he began rummaging
around. Presently he came back into
the garden, with his arms full of little sticks,
and busied himself in a corner where the war
gardeners had a bed of radishes for work-day
refreshment.</p>

<p>“What are you doing now?” Anne stopped to
ask.</p>

<p>“Playing this is my garden. I’m building a
fence ’round it,” explained Sweet William.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Phew! What a horrid smell! It smells like—why,
I smell kerosene oil,” said Anne, sniffing
and frowning.</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s these little sticks,” he said.
“They’re all smelly.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get them?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“From under the back-porch steps.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer!” said Anne. “I wonder——”</p>

<p>“Come on, Anne, and let’s start our next rows
at the same time, so we can race—and talk,”
called Patsy.</p>

<p>Anne went her way and forgot the little sticks
that smelled of oil.</p>

<p>Sweet William put them aside presently and
had a party—filling some oyster shells with make-believe
dainties and setting them out on a flat
stone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mallett, who came to consult Mrs. Wilson
about some Red Cross work, paused to watch the
youngster who was the Village pet.</p>

<p>“You are having a fine party, ain’t you?” she
said.</p>

<p>“It’s a birthday party,” he said. “But I’m just
having ash-cake. I reckon Mr. Hoover wouldn’t
want me to have fruit cake and pie. Mother says
he wants us to save everything we can, so as to
feed our armies and our Allies.”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart!” she said. “I wish the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
grown folks ’round here would act that way.
You know,” she said, turning to Mrs. Wilson,
“those Andrewses and Joneses and Walthalls
aren’t making a mite of change in the way they
eat, for all the government tells them ‘food will
win the war’ and ‘if we waste at home, our boys
over there will go hungry.’”</p>

<p>“I know. Food has become sacred; it means
life,” said Mrs. Wilson. “It is dreadful that
some of our own people are so slow to realize
the situation and their duty. Miranda Osborne
and I carried the government pamphlets to the
Andrewses and Joneses and Walthalls and talked
to them, but they listened as if their minds were
shut and locked. They think, as Gordan Jones
said, those who raise wheat and corn and hogs
have a right to use all the flour and meal and
meat they please.”</p>

<p>“A right! Who with a heart and conscience
wants the right to use victuals extravagant when
other folks are starving? Well, I must go and
take this wool to the women that said they would
knit.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” said Sweet William,
scrambling to his feet. “I’d rather go visiting
with you than to stay here and play party by
myself.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mallett gladly accepted his company, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
with Scalawag at his heels, he trotted along with
her, to collect knitted garments and dispense
wool.</p>

<p>Suddenly Scalawag, usually a well-mannered
dog that did not interfere with people on the
public road, ran at a negro boy, barking furiously.
The boy jerked up a stone, and Scalawag came
back to Sweet William’s heels, whimpering and
growling. As soon as they were at a safe distance,
he again barked angrily.</p>

<p>“I never saw him do that way before,” said
Sweet William; “never, but that night in the
garden.”</p>

<p>“Who was he barking at then?” asked Mrs.
Mallett.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Scalawag’s master; and
then he told about his trip to Broad Acres the
night before the gardens were destroyed and
about the dog’s queer behavior.</p>

<p>“H’m!” Mrs. Mallett said thoughtfully. “Who
was that boy we passed?”</p>

<p>“Kit, Lincum Gabe’s boy,” said Sweet William.
“Scalawag’s met him a hundred times, I
reckon, and never noticed him before.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” Mrs. Mallett repeated. “Sweet William,
you tell Mr. Black Mayo how this dog acted
to-day, and about that night. Some dogs have
got a lot of sense, and some are pure fools; they’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
just like folks. Well, here’s a place we’ve got to
stop,” she said, frowning at the pea-green gabled
and turreted house that was the outward and
visible sign of Gordan Jones’s prosperity.</p>

<p>The door was wide open, and in response to
Mrs. Mallett’s knock there was a hearty “Come
in!” She and Sweet William walked through the
hall and turned into the dining room where Mr.
and Mrs. Jones were sitting at the dinner table.</p>

<p>“O—oh!” Sweet William stared at the table.
It was strangely unlike what he was used to at
home these days. Why, it was loaded with food,
vegetables swimming in sauces and gravies, two
or three kinds of meat, hot biscuits, cakes, and
pies. “O-o-oh!” he said again.</p>

<p>“Howdy, folks!” called Mr. Jones, a stout man
in shirt sleeves. “Come in, come in, you-all, and
set down to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Howdy, Mrs. Mallett,” said Mrs. Jones, getting
up to greet the guests. “And howdy, little
man. It’s Mr. Red Mayo’s little boy, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes; it’s William, Sweet William Osborne,”
said Mrs. Mallett, stiffly. “I just come to bring
you the wool you said——”</p>

<p>“Here, here!” interrupted Mr. Jones’s big
voice. “Eat first and then do your talking.
We’ve got plenty victuals for you.” He laughed
and surveyed the table with pride. “Come and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
eat with us, Mrs. Mallett. Come on, little boy,
and set right here by me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the little French and Belgians!” exclaimed
Sweet William, whose eyes had never
moved from the table.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mr. Jones,” said Mrs. Mallett,
drawing her lips into a tight line. “Now, Mrs.
Jones, this wool——”</p>

<p>“Aw, come along and set and eat,” urged Mr.
Jones, hospitably. “I want you to sample this
old home-cured ham; and that’s prime good bacon
with the greens.”</p>

<p>The little woman’s face flushed and her eyes
snapped. “Mr. Jones,” she said, “them victuals
would choke me.”</p>

<p>“Wh-what?” He gazed at her with blank astonishment.</p>

<p>“I can’t set down to a gorge like that,” she
said. “I’d be thinking ’bout them hungry mouths
over there.”</p>

<p>“Starving Belgians and French,” interjected
Sweet William.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mallett hurried on: “Yes, them and our
other Allies; they’ve got no time to raise wheat
and such; their farmers are fighting their war
and ours, and the women are working in munition
factories and taking the men’s places at
home. And there are our boys—my boy—going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
over there, depending on us at home to send them
food. If we are lazy and selfish and don’t raise
it, or if we are greedy and selfish and use it
wasteful and extravagant, what’s to become of
them?”</p>

<p>“Why, why”—Mr. Jones was bewildered—“I
raised all that’s on this table, ’cept a little sugar
and such, that if I didn’t buy somebody else
would. I always was a good provider; we’re used
to a good table, and nobody’s got a right to ask me
to live stinting,” he said, with rising anger.</p>

<p>“They’ve got a right to ask me to give my son,
my own flesh and blood,” said Mrs. Mallett, with
a fire of righteous wrath that paled Mr. Jones’s
flicker of temper. “And yet you think they
haven’t got a right to ask you to give up your hot
biscuits and meat three times a day! S’pose you
<i>are</i> used to being a good provider? Ain’t I used
to going to bed easy in mind about my boy Fayett—and
any day I may hear he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“They oughtn’t to have sent him, your boy,”
mumbled Mr. Jones. “They’ve got no business to
send our men over there to fight, and maybe——”</p>

<p>“They’ve got all the right to send him to fight
for his country. But Fayett didn’t wait for any
draft. He went of his free will—I’m glad and
proud of it—to fight for liberty. And if he dies,
I want it to be the Germans that kill him. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
want you, that have known him since he was a
curly-headed baby boy, to be the ones to help
kill him.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Mallett!” Mrs. Jones said in a
hurt, amazed voice. “We wouldn’t harm a hair
of his head; not for the world, we wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’d do anything I could to bring him back
safe home,” said Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>“That’s what you say,” the little woman cried
passionately. “But words don’t count. And you
are doing your part to starve him. They can’t
get food over there, unless we send it to them.
It’s being rationed out to folks in France and
Italy. The English ships that used to go to South
America to get wheat are busy taking over our
soldiers and munitions and food, food, food. And
there’s just so-o much and all the world to feed—the
world and my soldier boy. If we use it wasteful,
there won’t be any to send. Yes, sir! I say
your good dinner would choke me. I’d feel I
was helping to kill my own son. You may not
mean it, but it’s true that every time you set down
to a meal like this you are helping kill my son,
beat our armies, make the Germans win.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want your cake, your pie,” sobbed
Sweet William. “I’m hungry, but I—I want to
be hungry.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones pushed back her plate and sobbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
with him. “I can’t swallow a morsel,” she declared.
“I can just see Fayett, like when he was
a little boy playing with my Tommy”—her own
son who was dead—“when they’d come in and
say, ‘We’re hungry; give us a snack!’ I ain’t
never said ‘no’ to them.” She buried her tear-wet
face in her apron.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones winked hard and cleared his throat
loudly. “Come, come, mother,” he said. “Don’t
you cry. We hadn’t thought ’bout things like she
put ’em. I reckon you are right, Mrs. Mallett.
Yes, you are! A man that won’t work at home
for them that’s fighting over there for him ain’t
much of a man. The world to feed—and Fayett!
I’ll double the crop of wheat I was going to put
in, and I’ll—say, Mrs. Mallett, if you won’t take
a feed with me, won’t you and the little boy set
and have a bite?”</p>

<p>“That I will, thank you,” said Mrs. Mallett,
smiling through tears. “I didn’t mean to fault
you too rough, Mr. Jones. But when I think
’bout them things, it’s like I had a pot in me that
was boiling over.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Mr. Jones. “You
put it strong to me; and we’ll put it strong to
other folks. We must see Jake Andrews and
Pete Walthall, and make ’em know what they’ve
got to do. We won’t have men here in our neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
that are so low-down and greedy and
selfish they won’t do their part. We’ll see to
them! What’ll you have, Mrs. Mallett? some
corn bread and greens and a bit of bacon? Folks
have got to eat, you know, so they can work. Um,
um! What’ll I do ’bout my hounds?”</p>

<p>“Come now, Willie, you’ll have a cake and a
piece of pie, being as they’re here and got to be
et,” said Mrs. Jones, bustling about to get plates
and chairs.</p>

<p>Sweet William gravely and wistfully considered
the matter. “We don’t have cakes at
home,” he said. “But these cakes are already
made—with icing tops and raisins! I reckon it
won’t hurt for me to eat one—maybe two, to save
them. The little Belgians couldn’t get this sugar
anyway.” He sighed, not altogether sad, and
fell to with a will.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE war gardeners went home at noon,
but they came back late in the afternoon.
When they finished the tasks they
had set themselves, Mrs. Wilson suggested that
they take eggs and radishes and lettuce, and meal
to make ash-cakes, and have a picnic supper at
Happy Acres; they might find some berries to
add to the feast, and the boys were always hoping
to catch fish in Tinkling Water, though they seldom
did.</p>

<p>The plan was welcomed with enthusiasm, and
they had a merry time and came home in the twilight.
Anne, who was to spend the night at
Broad Acres, sat on the porch with Mrs. Wilson
and Ruth, knitting and talking.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it dear of our old soldiers,” said Ruth,
“to g-g-give up going to the Reunion, and have
just the little service and parade here, and give
their money to the Red Cross, to help in the
war?”</p>

<p>Anne laughed. “Oh, Ruthie! You said ‘the
war’ about this war,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, why not?” Having used the word inadvertently,
Ruth now defended it. “There never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
was such a big war in the world. And we are in
it; it is our war; some Village b-boys are there
and others are going. It is The War, isn’t it,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” her mother answered slowly. “This is
The War. The other—we’ve been living in its
shine and shadow all these years—it is history
now; a war. Why, our old soldiers put in acts
what none of us before have put in words—that
this is The War, our war.”</p>

<p>Presently the girls yawned and their fingers
went more and more slowly with their knitting.
Mrs. Wilson said an early bed hour would be
the fitting end to their strenuous day. So they
went upstairs, and Ruth escorted Anne to a spacious
guest chamber.</p>

<p>“This is the room W-Washington stayed in,”
said Ruth.</p>

<p>“I love it,” said Anne, looking around. “Oh!
I love Broad Acres. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>Ruth laughed. “Love it? Why, it’s a part of
us. The way-back-grandfather that c-c-came
from England built it like his home there, and
all our people since have lived here. It’s home.”
Her voice lingered and thrilled on the word.
Then she threw her arms around Anne and
kissed her.</p>

<p>Anne had left her own old home early in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
orphaned childhood, and now lived, as an adopted
daughter, with friends in Washington. She was
happy there and dearly loved; but Ruth, with her
intense devotion to home and family, was always
distressed when she remembered that Anne
“didn’t belong to her own folks.”</p>

<p>“I w-wish you lived with us,” she said, kissing
Anne, again and again.</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t have the fun of coming to
see you,” her cousin reminded her, returning the
caresses.</p>

<p>“Sweet William says having you all the time
would be like having Christmas all the year.”</p>

<p>Anne laughed.</p>

<p>“Anne darling,” said Ruth, “I was g-going to
stay with you to-night, but mother has a headache
and may want a hot-water bottle or something.
You’ll not mind my staying with her?
We’ll be across the hall, at the other end.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m used to staying alone,” said Anne.
“My room at home is across the hall from Aunt
Sarah’s.”</p>

<p>Ruth went out and Anne undressed and
climbed into the great bed. She lay there, looking
out into the soft summer night, listening to a
mocking bird’s joyous melody. There was a
magnolia tree in blossom near the front window
and the night breeze wafted in the delicious odor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
of the blossoms. How beautiful and peaceful it
all was! Could anything be lovelier than those
great white magnolia blossoms, shining like
moons in the dark foliage? Blossom-moons—fragrant
white moons—moons—— The moons
came nearer and nearer. And as they drew
nearer, they changed. They were no longer white
and fragrant. They were red and hot. Why,
they were bombs, bombs that Germans were
throwing. They exploded with a great noise and
blinding flame and thick, pungent, choking smoke.</p>

<p>“Whizz-bangs, that’s what they are,” Anne
thought, recalling something she had read about
bombs that exploded time and time again, like
Chinese firecrackers.</p>

<p>She wanted to get away from them, but she
could not. She was in the thick of the battle.</p>

<p>Suddenly she sat up in bed and opened her eyes.
The room was filled with smoke and there was a
glare and a roar around her. Were the Germans
here, attacking The Village? Then her senses
awoke. The sounds that she heard were not the
bursting of bombs, but fire crackling and voices
shouting.</p>

<p>She sprang up and ran to the door. Smoke
poured in, and through it she saw leaping flames,
a great column of fire rising from the stairway
between her and her cousin’s room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Cousin Agnes! Cousin Agnes! Ruth! oh,
Ruth!” she called at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer. There was only the
horrible roar of the mounting flames. She
slammed the door to shut out the noise which was
more terrifying than the smoke and the flames.
She ran to a front window. The yard was full
of people, her friends and cousins, who seemed
very far away and strange, with their excited,
anxious faces lighted by the red glare of the conflagration.</p>

<p>Some one saw her as soon as she opened the
shutter and raised a shout of relief. “There she
is! There’s Anne!”</p>

<p>“Anne, Anne! Oh, Anne!”</p>

<p>There was an agonized screech from old
Emma. The words were lost in the roar of the
fire or unheeded in the excitement; but Dick knew
afterward that he heard her yell, “That old
devil! he’s burnin’ up little Miss Anne!”</p>

<p>For a minute Anne stood dazed and motionless
at the window. But now the fire had eaten
through the door; the air was stifling with lurid
smoke; the roaring, crackling flames came nearer.
She was gasping, choking. She climbed on the
window sill.</p>

<p>“Don’t jump! don’t jump! We’ll get you in a
minute!” called Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>She stood still. It was a fearful distance; she
might break her arm, leg, neck; but—she moved
restlessly—anything would be better than being
caught by those awful flames.</p>

<p>“Wait, Anne, wait!” called Mrs. Osborne.
“Wait! They are bringing a ladder.”</p>

<p>A group of men came around the corner of
the house, dragging a ladder. They raised it, but
in their haste it was pushed too far to one side
and caught on the window blind. Anne clutched
at a swaying rung.</p>

<p>“Stop, Anne! Steady, old girl, steady!”</p>

<p>Dick pushed past Mr. Mallett, went like a cat
up the ladder, steadied the upper end of it against
the window sill, while Anne climbed down.</p>

<p>Explanations came by degrees, piecemeal, in
ejaculations. When Mrs. Wilson and Ruth
awakened, the flames had made a wall across the
hall which they could not cross. They called and
called Anne, but she did not answer.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s what I heard in my sleep!” exclaimed
Anne. “I thought you were the Germans.”</p>

<p>At last they had to shut the door as a temporary
barrier to the fire. When it blazed, they
climbed on a trellis below one of the windows.
There they clung till help came.</p>

<p>Miss Fanny Morrison, who lived in the cottage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
next door, had awakened at last and she ran out,
screaming and beating at doors, and aroused The
Village.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Wilson and Ruth and Anne
were rescued, people set to work to save the contents
of the house. But the upper floor was cut
off by the burning of the staircase, and the fire
had now made such headway that they succeeded
in getting only a few articles from the lower
rooms. The rapidly advancing flames drove them
back and they stood, in helpless, sorrowful
groups, like watchers at a deathbed.</p>

<p>“Oh, my home! my home!” sobbed poor Mrs.
Wilson.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne threw her arms around her.
“Thank God, you and Anne and Ruth are safe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Thank God for that. But my
home, my precious home!”</p>

<p>“Go with Miranda, Agnes; go to The Roost,”
urged Red Mayo. “Don’t distress yourself staying
here. We will put your things in the schoolhouse;
that’s safe, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>But the poor lady stood and watched, with
fascinated horror, the flames racing through the
house and thrusting fierce, demonlike tongues
out of the windows.</p>

<p>“Stand back! out of the way!” shouted Red
Mayo and Will Blair. The roof had caught;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
there was a great burst of flame, burning shingles
soared through the air. Fortunately, it was a
windless night and the Village houses were far
apart, in lawns and groves.</p>

<p>After that great upflare, the fire subsided.
When the east wall toppled and crashed down,
there was another fierce spurt of flame. Then
the fire died down. And at last they all went
sadly home.</p>

<p>In the gray morning, an old, bent, black negro
man crept out of a shed on The Back Way and
looked with a curious mixture of triumph and
terror at the smoldering ruin, the blackened walls
with the windows like ghastly loopholes. That
was all that was left of Broad Acres, which had
been for over a hundred years a home and a landmark.</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll stay right here with us,”
said Mrs. Red Mayo Osborne to Mrs. Wilson, the
next morning.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly!” Mr. Osborne was surprised
that his wife considered it necessary to say so.</p>

<p>“You and Ruth.” “Of course you will.” “Oh,
yes!” and “Sure!” exclaimed Patsy, Sweet William,
David, and Dick.</p>

<p>“Why, dears, you haven’t room for us,” said
Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>“Certainly, there is plenty of room,” said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Osborne. “I have it all planned. You and Ruth
will stay in ‘the bedroom,’ Patsy will move out
of it, into the dressing room that Sweet William
will give up. He can sleep on a pallet in ‘the
chamber’ or go into the ‘tumble-up room’ with
Dick and David. Of course you will stay here.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you are saying?” asked Black
Mayo, who came up the walk just then. “‘Stay
here?’ You aren’t hoping you can have Agnes
and Ruth with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” said Patsy. “Now, don’t you
come and try to hog them away. They are going
to live with us.”</p>

<p>“Indeed they are not,” declared Black Mayo.
“They’re going to Larkland. Van is on the way
with the wagon, Agnes, to carry your things. Of
course you are coming to us. Why, we really
need you. Think of all those big empty rooms.
And you’ll be such company for Polly when I’m
away.”</p>

<p>While he was arguing the matter, the Miss
Morrisons came up the walk, followed by Mr.
Tavis and Mr. Mallett.</p>

<p>Miss Elmira was an invalid, but she had
hobbled across The Street with Miss Fanny to
invite Mrs. Wilson and Ruth to come to their
cottage.</p>

<p>“It is so convenient, with just the grove between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
it and Broad—the schoolhouse,” said Miss
Fanny. “And it’s just right for two families;
there are two rooms on each side, with the hall
between, like a street, and we’ll be just as particular
about crossing it, we assure you.”</p>

<p>“We spoke for them first. Stay with us,
Cousin Agnes, you and Ruth; please do,” pleaded
Sweet William.</p>

<p>“No; they want a home of their own,” said
Mr. Mallett. “Miss Agnes, I ain’t got a house
to ask you to, not to call it a house; it’s just a hole
to put my gang of children in. I come to say we-all
are going to build you a house. We’ve been
talking it over, Joe Spencer and Benny Hight
and a bunch of others; everybody wants to help.
There’s the sawmill in the Big Woods, and we’ll
cut trees and haul lumber and——”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” said Mr. Tavis, in his high, wheezy
voice. “Ain’t no sense in building a house, when
there’s one all ready for Miss Agnes and her gal
to live in. I built a big house with upstairs and
all that, ’cause I had the money and I wanted a
place like you-alls. My old woman and me are
used to living in one or two rooms, and it comes
awkward to have so much house ’round us. We’re
going to move in the little room next to the
kitchen, and, Miss Agnes, you’re to take the rest
of the house; you’re used to having room to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
spread yourself. We cert’n’ly will be thankful
to you.”</p>

<p>“Dear people! my people! my own family, all
of you!” Mrs. Wilson said; it was some minutes
before she could speak between sobs. “I can’t
tell you—I never can say—how grateful I am—how
I love you all, for—for being so dear and
good to me.”</p>

<p>“Dear Agnes!” Mrs. Osborne’s arms were
around her.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallett cleared his throat loudly. “Good to
you!” he said. “Ain’t you taught my children
and every Village child, never asking if you’d
get pay or not, and beating sense in them that
ain’t got no sense, and——”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I seen you grow up from a baby, age
of my girl that’s dead?” said Mr. Tavis, blowing
his nose like a trumpet.</p>

<p>Sweet William wailed aloud.</p>

<p>“Sh, sh, son!” His mother soothed him. “Why
are you crying?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” sobbed Sweet William. “I—I
just got to cry.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know I could love you all better than
I did!” exclaimed Mrs. Wilson. “Oh, you are
so good, so dear! But we’ve made up our minds,
Ruth and I, what we are going to do. We are going
to live in the schoolhouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“But, Agnes——” began Red Mayo.</p>

<p>“But, Mayo!” she said. “It was the Broad
Acres ‘office,’ just as The Roost here where you
live was the ‘office’ of Osborne’s Rest, and it’s
almost as large. There are two big rooms and a
little one. Oh! there is room and room enough
for Ruth and me.”</p>

<p>“But, Miss Agnes——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Cousin Agnes——”</p>

<p>“Agnes dear——”</p>

<p>“But me no more buts,” she said, laughing
through her tears. “It is best; I know it is best
for us to make our home there. There’ll not be
room for the Red Cross work——”</p>

<p>“We’ll take that,” said Miss Fanny, hastily.</p>

<p>“You wont! I will,” asserted Mr. Tavis.</p>

<p>It was at last decided that the Red Cross workers
were to occupy the Miss Morrisons’ spare
rooms, and Mr. Tavis was comforted with the
promise of furnishing a schoolroom in the
autumn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson had her way about living in the
cottage in Broad Acres yard, but The Village had
its way about furnishing the rooms. At first
people came pell-mell, haphazard, with their best
and filled the cottage to overflowing. Then Polly
Osborne, who was the soul of order and common
sense, took charge of things. She made a list of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
house furnishings that had been saved and of
those that were needed, and accepted and rejected
offerings accordingly. She sent back several center
tables and big clocks and three or four dozen
parlor chairs, and asked for kitchen utensils and
bed linen.</p>

<p>By nightfall, the little home-to-be contained
the choicest offerings of The Village. In the bedroom
were the Blairs’ best mahogany wardrobe
and bureau, and the Black Mayo Osbornes’ four-poster
bedstead arrayed with the Red Mayo Osbornes’
lavendered linen sheets. The kitchen
stove had been saved and a procession of housewives
had piled up utensils and pantry supplies.
In the living room Mr. Tavis’s red plush rocking-chair
reposed on the Miss Morrisons’ best rag
rug.</p>

<p>Beside the window was a bookcase full of
books, clothbound and sheepskin old volumes that
had been read and loved, and that had old names
in them, like Mrs. Wilson’s own dear lost volumes
which had belonged to the forefathers of The Village.
There was a note from Black Mayo, saying
of course it did not make any real difference
whose house the books were in, because they belonged
to any one who wished to read them, but
he’d rather they’d be in her home so his wife
would not have them to dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Mrs. Wilson laughed and cried as she read the
note.</p>

<p>A procession of people came in with food that
broke all conservation rules—beaten biscuits,
batter-yeast bread, fried chicken, baked ham, and
countless varieties of jams and jellies and pickles
and preserves.</p>

<p>It was bedtime when at last Mrs. Wilson and
Ruth were left alone. They undressed and hand
in hand, they knelt at their bedside, and then they
lay down to rest in the new home, shadowed by
the ruins that had been home the night before.</p>

<p>Who would have thought it possible for so sad
a day to be so happy?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">LIKE most Southern communities, The Village
had not the habit of celebrating the
Fourth of July. It had its fireworks and
jollifications at Christmas, which was the gala
season of its year, a whole week of holiday and
feasting.</p>

<p>But now that the United States was in the
World War, Independence Day acquired a new
and deeper meaning. There were flags and addresses
in the Court-house, and they sang “The
Star-Spangled Banner” after “Dixie.” Then
there was a picnic dinner, with plenty of fried
chicken and a hooverized amount of ice cream
and cake.</p>

<p>The pleasant new patriotic enthusiasm about
the Fourth was tremendously deepened two days
later when Black Mayo came to the war gardens
and told the workers about that wonderful
American Fourth of July in France.</p>

<p>The American Expeditionary Force had
crossed the submarine-infested ocean and had
landed, every man safe, at “a seaport of France.”
On the Fourth, the splendid, brave, eager fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
in khaki and blue jackets marched along the
streets of Paris, hundreds and thousands of
them, forerunners of hundreds of thousands who
were coming.</p>

<p>Paris went wild with joy. The streets were
strewn with flowers; the Stars and Stripes waved
a welcome; French bands played “The Star-Spangled
Banner” and American bands responded
with the “Marseillaise.”</p>

<p>“<i>Vive l’Amérique! vive l’Amérique!</i>”</p>

<p>“Pershing’s boys are here!”</p>

<p>Ah, what a day it was!</p>

<p>The Americans were sorely needed in 1917.</p>

<p>In the west, British and French and Belgians
were bravely holding the entrenched long line
from the Alps to the Channel. But alas! for
the east. There was a revolution in Russia, beginning
with bread riots in Petrograd. Patriots
echoed anxiously the prayer of the abdicating
Czar: “May God help Russia!” as she dropped
from the ranks of fighting Allies and became the
battleground of warring factions.</p>

<p>German submarines continued to take their
toll on the seas. And German air raids grew
more frequent. Night after night Zeppelins swept
down, like huge, evil birds of prey; day after
day airplanes darted and dived like swallows.
People heard the whir of motors, the explosion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of bombs, the rattle of anti-aircraft guns; in a
few minutes it was over, all but the counting of
the wounded and the dead, chiefly women and
children.</p>

<p>The Village listened with interest to all news
from overseas as a part of “our war.” Then it
turned to the work at home.</p>

<p>In June men registered in obedience to the
Draft Act. One day in July the Secretary of
War, blindfolded, drew one capsule out of a
great jar; it was opened; on a slip of paper in it
was a number. Another capsule was drawn out;
and another; and another. All day and until long
after midnight went on that drawing of capsules
containing numbers.</p>

<p>And the numbers, when they came to The Village
and to all the country places and little towns
and great cities of the whole nation, were no
longer mere numbers, but names; and when they
went to the homes of the community they were
neither numbers nor names, but sons, brothers,
sweethearts, friends—men who had to go to
fight, perhaps to die, for the nation.</p>

<p>The end of the summer found nearly a million
men under arms and in training camps scattered
over the country. A great brave, efficient army
of soldiers was being formed. And everywhere
men and women and children were enrolled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the nation’s greater army of service, as patriotic
and brave and efficient and as necessary as soldiers.</p>

<p>The Second Liberty Loan was under way, and
people who had thought they had not a dollar
beyond their needs found they could “buy a bond
to help Uncle Sam win the war.”</p>

<p>There was Red Cross work to do—feeding the
hungry, clothing the naked, caring for the sick
and wounded; millions of people were helping
with money and service, at home and overseas.</p>

<p>Millions, too, were enrolled in the work of food
conservation. During that spring and summer
and autumn of 1917, crop reports were watched
as anxiously as news from the war front, for
even the children knew that “armies march on
their feet and on their stomachs.”</p>

<p>At family worship, night and morning, in that
little old-fashioned Presbyterian Village, voices
prayed God to bless our homes and soldiers and
Allies, and thanked Him for great ideals and
wholesome food, for President Wilson and
bounteous crops.</p>

<p>The crops were, indeed, bounteous. There
were record-breaking yields of corn and oats,
and an abundant yield of potatoes. The wheat
crop was smaller; we must stint at home, to send
supplies to Europe. But the country, going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
calmly through its sugar famine, was ready for
“meatless Tuesdays” and “wheatless Wednesdays”—anything,
everything to help win the war.</p>

<p>The members of Camp Fight Foe and Camp
Feed Friend went enthusiastically to Broad
Acres, one pleasant day in early autumn, to harvest
their crop of white potatoes.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallett, who had volunteered to help with
his horse and plow, ran a furrow beside each
row; potato diggers had never been heard of in
The Village. Behind him came the young gardeners—collecting
the tubers turned up by the
plow, picking them out of the soft soil, or raking
out those that were more deeply embedded. Not
one must be overlooked and left behind, for close
was the contest between the rival gardeners. The
bucket- and basketfuls of potatoes were emptied
into a half-bushel measure, over which Mrs.
Wilson presided, and then put into bags. The
gardeners were jubilant over the results of their
labors, and with reason. Mrs. Wilson said that
Broad Acres had never yielded a better crop than
the one they were harvesting.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this a crackerjack?” cried David, holding
up a huge tuber.</p>

<p>“Here’s a better one. It’s just as big as yours,
and it’s smooth, instead of being all bumpy,”
Patsy said critically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“O-oh!” wailed Ruth. “J-just see this lovely
one that the plow c-cut in two. It would have
been best of all. Isn’t it a pity?”</p>

<p>“These nice little round ones are loverly,” said
Sweet William, who was making a collection of
the tiny, smallest potatoes. “The little Belgians
can play marbles with them first, and then eat
them.”</p>

<p>“Alice, empty your basket in the measure and
let’s see if we haven’t another bushel,” called
Patsy.</p>

<p>“You girls! Make haste and put your potatoes
in a bag, so we can have the measure,” urged
Steve. “We’ll fill it in a hurry.”</p>

<p>When the last measureful was emptied, it was
found that the boys had a half peck more than
the girls.</p>

<p>“Yah! yah! Of course we beat you!” cried
Steve.</p>

<p>“By measuring all Sweet William’s marbles,”
Anne Lewis said scornfully. “Our potatoes are
bigger. And anyway you had four more hills
on your last row.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sirree! And this is the first crop out
of our gardens. You wait till we come to the
last,” said Patsy, confidently.</p>

<p>“Our gardens will feed a lot of soldiers,”
Sweet William said proudly. “They’ll take care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
of our Village boys a year—or a while, anyway.
Jeff’s such a big eater! We’re all working our
hardest; and Scalawag’s helping.”</p>

<p>Sweet William never tired of singing Scalawag’s
praises, since by his aid the destroyer of
the war gardens had been discovered and punished.</p>

<p>Kit, closely questioned by Mr. Black Mayo
Osborne, confessed that he had gone into the
garden, and had hidden behind the arbor when he
heard some one coming; he had kicked Scalawag,
to drive him away; and—he finally owned—he
had driven in the cow from the adjoining pasture.</p>

<p>He gave no reason except “because”; and Mr.
Osborne shook his head and frowned. There
was something back of this, he felt sure. What
was it? Were there wanton mischief-makers in
The Village? The burning of Broad Acres—was
it an accident, caused by rats and matches, as was
generally believed? He wondered, but he got no
clews, and other matters were disturbing him.
For the present, things went on their usual quiet
way in The Village.</p>

<p>When the gardeners started to dig potatoes,
Dick shrugged his shoulders and started off
whistling, as if he were having a grand good
time. But, to tell the truth, he was getting tired
of these excursions to the mine. He continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
them, at more and more infrequent intervals,
chiefly to plague Anne and Patsy.</p>

<p>Time after time they had left gardening and
Red Cross work and followed him. Sometimes
he had turned across a field, and twisted and
doubled—like an old red fox, to which Black
Mayo compared him—and made a successful
get-away.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in a teasing humor, he kept just
far enough ahead to encourage them to continue
the pursuit and led them over miles of rough
country and back to The Village; then he would
ask, with an exasperating grin, “Haven’t we had
a lovely walk?”</p>

<p>Anne looked after him to-day and said, as
often before, “Oh! I wish we could find out Dick’s
secret.”</p>

<p>“If just we could!” Patsy replied; “but—well,
sometimes I think we might as well give up. We
can’t keep on forever trotting after him, with the
Red Cross and Camp Feed Friend and the
Canning Club and Happy Acres and all the
other things there are to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Pats-pet! We’ll not give up,” Anne
said decidedly. “There’s some way to manage
it. But of course we mustn’t take time from the
garden; not now, while there’s so much to do.
The main thing is to make our garden beat those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
bragging boys’. Oh! I’m so glad I’m going to
stay here this winter and see it through.”</p>

<p>On account of the housing shortage in Washington,
Anne’s adoptive parents had given up
their home to war workers, and Anne was to continue
her studies this winter with her cousins in
The Village; Mrs. Wilson was as good as a university
for scholarship.</p>

<p>Dick went by Larkland as usual. His Cousin
Mayo was silent and seemed preoccupied as they
went to the pigeon cote.</p>

<p>“Here’s a bird for you,” he said, taking one at
random.</p>

<p>Dick stood a minute with the caged pigeon in
his hand, then said abruptly: “Cousin Mayo, you
told me that you were going in the army.
When?”</p>

<p>“Hey?” Black Mayo gave a start.</p>

<p>Dick repeated his question.</p>

<p>His cousin frowned. “I don’t know,” he said.
“I don’t know. There are things here. I don’t
see how I can get away.”</p>

<p>Couldn’t get away! Why, Cousin Mayo had
always been footloose; he picked up, on a day’s
notice, and went to Alaska or Mexico or the
South Sea Islands, for a month or two, or a year
or two. And now to say he couldn’t get away!
People were saying he stayed at home because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
he was a coward and a slacker. It was not true.
And why were they saying it about Cousin Mayo
and not about other men who didn’t go to war?</p>

<p>Dick went on toward the mine, feeling mystified
and worried. He proceeded cautiously as
usual, varying his route and making cut-offs and
circuits to avoid possible observation and pursuit.
The door of Solomon Gabe’s cabin was open, as
it often was, revealing nothing in the gloomy interior.
Dick circled behind the hovel, going
rather close to keep away from a little swamp.
The place was usually as silent as the grave.
But now he heard two voices—Solomon Gabe’s
old monotone and another voice that he felt he
might have recognized if it had been a little
louder. He scurried along the edge of the
swamp, and in a minute he was out of sight and
hearing.</p>

<p>He paused at Mine Creek as usual to set free
his bird. It perched on his shoulder a moment;
then it soared up and wheeled and was off.</p>

<p>Dick went on to the mine and stood several
minutes on the lookout before he put his ladder
into the hole and descended. He always took
precautions against stray passers-by, although in
all these months he had never seen any one thereabouts.</p>

<p>Down in the mine, he lighted a candle and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to one of the lower spurs and set to work, following
the line between a layer of clay and rock.
After a while he came to a projecting ledge of
rock and, using pick and sledge hammer with
difficulty, he broke off a piece. He picked it
up—it was very heavy—and looked at it. On
the broken surface there were bright specks and
streaks. How they shone and sparkled in the
candlelight! Silver! Ah, he had found it at last!</p>

<p>He sped to the mine opening to examine his
find by daylight, and his eager confidence was
confirmed. How beautifully the specks and
streaks glinted and glittered! He climbed out
and hid his ladder, and went homeward on winged
feet. He was too hurried and eager to take his
usual roundabout course; but he saw no one as
he sped along the Old Plank Road except Mr.
Smith, whom he passed on the hill beyond Peter
Jim’s cabin.</p>

<p>Dick dropped from a trot to a walk when he
came to The Village, and sauntered up The Street
to The Roost, where his father was sitting on the
porch reading a <i>Congressional Record</i>. With an
elaborate assumption of carelessness, Dick held
out the shining stone.</p>

<p>“See what I’ve found, father,” he said. “What
do you reckon it is?”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne examined the stone deliberately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“H-m! It is——”</p>

<p>A vagrant breeze caught the <i>Congressional
Record</i> and tossed it on the floor.</p>

<p>“Pick up that paper, son,” said Mr. Osborne,
“and smooth out the pages; gently, so as not to
tear them. You know I file——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But my rock, father!” Dick interrupted
in uncontrollable impatience.</p>

<p>“It is quartz,” said his father; “quartz with a
little silver in it. These minute particles and
streaks are free silver, such as is found occasionally
in the quartz in this section. This looks
like a poor specimen from the Old Sterling Mine.
Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I found it,” Dick said vaguely.</p>

<p>“Somewhere along Mine Creek, I presume,
my son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t venture too close to the old mine,”
cautioned his father. “Of course you wouldn’t
think of entering it. The timbers are probably
all decayed; there might be a cave-in any time.
It is a dangerous place.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Dick answered meekly.</p>

<p>And forthwith he went to Mr. Blair’s store
and invested his last dime in two candles. He
was very zealous about going to the mine for
some time after that, but he only succeeded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
chipping off a few bits rather worse than better
than the one he had first secured.</p>

<p>The glow of that little success died away, and
he felt discouraged and ashamed of himself when
his schoolmates held their garden exhibit in the
Tavern parlor.</p>

<p>All The Village and the surrounding country
gathered there on the evening of that crisp
autumn day, the last Saturday in October. The
big parlor that had been a gathering place since
stagecoach days had a gala air. It was decorated
with American flags, and the vegetables were
piled in pyramids on tables covered with red,
white, and blue tissue paper. Every withered
leaf had been cut from the cabbages. Each potato
and onion and tomato had been washed as
carefully as a baby’s face. The ears of corn had
the husks turned back and tied, and were fastened
in great bunches on the wall with tri-colored
streamers. By the side of each pile of
vegetables was a card saying how many bushels
or gallons or quarts the garden had yielded. The
girls had jars and jars of tomatoes, peas, beans,
corn, berries—canned, pickled, preserved.</p>

<p>On a neatly lettered card above the door were
the President’s words: “Every bushel of potatoes
properly stored, every pound of vegetables properly
put by for future use, every jar of fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
preserved, adds that much to our insurance of
victory, adds that much to hasten the end of this
conflict.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, dears,” quavered Mrs. Spencer’s
gentle old voice, as she looked around, “this exhibition
would be a credit to grown-up farmers
anywhere. I don’t believe,” she added thoughtfully,
“that people worked during The—that
other war, like they are working now. Of course
that was at home, and all our men were in it and
our women all felt it as a personal thing. But
people—well, they weren’t organized. Did you
ever know children do anything like this, all
this gardening and Red Cross work? Oh, it’s
wonderful, wonderful! And they’ve all worked—even
that dear little dove, Sweet William.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sweet William! I always knew you’re
a bird,” laughed Anne Lewis, who was standing
near. “Now I know the kind. You are a dove;
oh, you are a dove of war, like Cousin Mayo’s
birds!”</p>

<p>“Good, Anne!” said Black Mayo. “Sweet
William is a dove of war, and so are all you dear
children and all you good and lovely people here
and everywhere. Doves of war, harbingers of
real peace that can only come from winning this
war and securing freedom and human rights.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Mr. Osborne!” called Mr. Martin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
who was in charge of the County Corn Clubs:
“Mr. Jones and I are waiting for you. We judges
must get to work. And we’ve got no easy job,”
he said, looking around at the exhibits.</p>

<p>The garden produce was arranged in two
groups. No one except the contestants knew
which was the girls’ and which was the boys’.
The judges went from one to the other—looking,
admiring, considering, reconsidering. At last
they announced their decision: Both exhibits
were highly creditable, but this was the better.</p>

<p>There was a shout of joy from the girls. They
had won, they had won! After a little pause, the
boys—for they were generous rivals—joined in
the applause and congratulations.</p>

<p>Anne Lewis, who had suggested the war gardening,
was deputed by the girls to receive the
silver cup presented by Black Mayo Osborne, and
the blue ribbon; and David received the red ribbon
for the boys.</p>

<p>Dick Osborne looked so forlorn that David
said: “Cheer up, old boy! If you hadn’t been
busy about something else when we started the
garden, you’d have been in it with us.”</p>

<p>“I’m not much forwarder about that than I
was in April,” Dick confessed. “I’m going to
keep on trying, though. But if there’s a war
garden next year I’ll be in it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>“There isn’t any ‘if’ about it,” declared David.
“We are going to keep on gardening, to help win
the war. And we’ll get that cup back from the
girls next year; see if we don’t.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see—you don’t,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>Just then there was a little stir at the door.
Mr. Mallett, who had been to Redville on business,
came in and said something in an excited
undertone to Black Mayo Osborne. Mr. Osborne
asked a quick question or two, and then jumped
on a table and caught the big flag draped over
the mantelpiece and waved it above his head.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurrah!” he said. “News, great
news!”</p>

<p>“The Liberty Loan has gone over the top,”
guessed Red Mayo.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course! But something else is
going over the top. Our American boys! They
are facing the Germans in ‘No Man’s Land.’ To-day,
to-day for the first time, our American boys
were in the first-line trenches on the French
front. Hurrah! hurrah! We are in The War!”</p>

<p>Every voice joined in a cheer that rang and
rang again. Mr. Tavis and the other old Confederates
raised the “rebel yell,” their old valiant
battle cry. The children clapped their hands and
shouted: “We are in it! We are in it! We are
in The War!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>Sweet William clapped and cheered with the
best. Then he turned to his mother. “What
does it mean, mother, our men ‘in the trenches’?”
he asked. “Does it mean we’ve beat the war?”</p>

<p>“It means our soldiers are over there, fighting
side by side with our Allies against the Germans,”
explained his mother. “I don’t know
whether it’s defeat or victory to-day; but we
Americans will stay there till we win The War—if
you and I have to go to help, little son—to
conquer the world for peace and freedom.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN his Christmas sermon, the Village minister
gave thanks that the British, in this twentieth-century
crusade of liberty, had accomplished
the purpose of the old Crusades and had wrested
Jerusalem, the Holy City, from the Turks who
had held it for nearly seven hundred years. And
a few Sundays later, he charged each citizen to
take, as his New Year’s resolution for the nation,
the “fourteen principles of peace” formulated
by the first citizen of America and of the world.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving and peace terms! Those were
the things people were taking as matters of
course, feeling sure, that now America was in the
war, the victorious end would come, and that
soon. But days began to darken. The spring
of 1918 was a tragic, anxious time.</p>

<p>Germany had failed to clear the seas and win
the war with submarines. Every few minutes
a wooden or steel or concrete ship left the New
World, bearing soldiers and food and munitions,
and ninety-nine per cent of them came safe to
harbor; soon there would be millions of trained
and equipped doughboys in Europe. Germany’s
one chance was to strike a decisive blow on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
Western Front before those fast-coming Americans
were there in full force.</p>

<p>And Germany was ready to strike that blow.
The Reds’ shameful peace at Brest-Litovsk enabled
her to mass armies in the west. She had
there Von Hindenburg and Ludendorff and six
million soldiers. And having the inner lines, she
could concentrate troops and outnumber the Allies
two or three to one in every attack, although they
had eight million men.</p>

<p>Late in March, the great German offensive
began.</p>

<p>The first drive was on a fifty-mile front. It
swept onward with terrible force, capturing vast
numbers of prisoners and guns. The monster
guns in the St. Gobain Forest dropped shells on
a church in the heart of Paris. Late in April,
that drive was checked, but the Germans had
thrust forward thirty-four miles on their way to
the French capital.</p>

<p>Before that first drive was halted, the second
drive began in Flanders; its purpose was to reach
the Channel ports and to cut off the British Army
from the French and Americans. The British
held their broken ranks and stood “with their
backs to the wall.” The Germans were again
checked, but they had advanced ten long, hard-fought
miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>The Village received with growing dismay the
tidings from the battle front. Months ago the
older men had offered themselves for war service
and formed a company, and now they drilled
regularly on Court-house Green. They might as
well be ready, in case they were needed, said Red
Mayo Osborne.</p>

<p>Black Mayo Osborne did not join the company.
Nor did he enter the army as he had said months
before he was going to do. He spent a great deal
of his time wandering about the countryside,
with baskets of pigeons, seemingly unconscious
of the sneers at his expense—that came most
frequently and openly from men who were leaving
no stone of political influence unturned, to
keep themselves and their sons and brothers out
of the army.</p>

<p>One of Black Mayo’s favorite walks was toward
the high bridge, eight miles from The Village,
where frequent trains bearing soldiers and
supplies crawled across the long, high trestle far
above the river and the lowlands.</p>

<p>One day as he was sauntering near the bridge,
he saw a man and boy who were following a by-path
through the woods. Circling through a pine
thicket, he came near enough to hear part of
their conversation.</p>

<p>The man was not speaking English, but Black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
Mayo understood what he was saying: “Not
train time. You walk the bridge and”—there
Black Mayo missed some words.</p>

<p>“No,” the boy said curtly.</p>

<p>The man insisted.</p>

<p>“That will I not!” declared the boy, speaking
in English. “Nothing to hurt, all to help!”</p>

<p>“Coward that you are!” the man cried in his
guttural language. “You, a boy as at play, could
do it without suspicion. Must I risk, not only
myself, but the Cause?”</p>

<p>Then he discovered Black Mayo, almost at his
elbow, apparently intent on the pigeons—scrawling
a line and affixing it to a bird. He released
it; it soared, circled, and was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith knew that, at that nearness, Mr.
Osborne must have heard his words and understood
probably his purpose. With an oath he
jerked out a pistol. Albert caught his arm, and
before he could free it and take aim, Black Mayo
said: “Look out! That pigeon carried my message
home: ‘High bridge. Threatened by Smith.’”</p>

<p>For a minute the two men stood silent, face to
face.</p>

<p>Smith thought quickly. To shoot down this
unarmed man whom he hated—only to be arrested
as a murderer—— The game was not
worth the candle. He spoke with an angry laugh:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
“You did startle me. <i>Ach!</i> I was talking nonsense
with my nephew. Go, with your little birds!
But if”—he scowled, and his evil left eye became
a mere glinting spark—“if you make harm where
there is none, I will shoot you with my last act.”</p>

<p>Black Mayo considered a moment before he
answered: “I will go home and receive my own
message. But I will put another where it will
be found the minute harm comes to me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith laughed and put his pistol into his
pocket. “Go, save your skin,” he sneered. Then
he said to his nephew: “<i>Ach!</i> That is the man
you adore, a coward who dares not tell on me
for fear of himself. It is well. The German
victory is a matter now of the days.”</p>

<p>Was that indeed true? Every day brought
new Allied losses; guns and men and miles; on
the north the English were being forced back; in
the south the French were being forced back.</p>

<p>But in that time of dire need, two new factors
entered the war. One was Foch as commander-in-chief;
the other was the Americans.</p>

<p>Instead of being many, the Allied armies became
one; American Pershing, British Haig,
French Pétain, Italian Diaz, Belgian Albert,
served under Foch, whom all the world knew as
a brilliant strategist.</p>

<p>So far the American troops had been in training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
and held in reserve. But late in May newspapers
had two news items. One announced, in
glaring headlines, that the Germans had advanced
ten miles, crossed two rivers, and taken
twenty-five thousand prisoners; the other said,
in small type, that the Americans had advanced
their lines and taken the village of Cantigny and
two hundred prisoners. A big advance and a
little one. Ah! but in that day at Cantigny the
Americans were tried and not found wanting.</p>

<p>The Germans, already talking of a “hard
peace,” pushed forward on their “Victory Drive”
toward Paris. Hundreds of square miles were
taken, and thousands of prisoners and guns.
They crossed the Marne River and reached
Château-Thierry, only forty miles from Paris.</p>

<p>Had Foch and the Americans come too late?</p>

<p>Ah! now they moved, swiftly and successfully,
both of them. Foch had let the Germans advance
so as to make flank attacks. The Americans,
given the post of honor at Château-Thierry,
drove back the best of the Germans and carried
positions deemed impregnable. Up and down
the long battle line from the Alps to the North
Sea, went the tidings: “The Americans have held
the Germans. They are as good as our best. A
million of them are here, and there are millions
ready to come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>The Germans made their last great offensive,
a desperate drive on a sixty-mile front toward
Paris. They were checked. They retreated.
The Allies took the offensive.</p>

<p>During these stirring days, The Village could
not wait the leisurely roundabout course of the
mail rider and accept day-old papers as “news.”
Some one rode every day to Redville and brought
back the morning <i>Dispatch</i> and then the war
news was read aloud in the post office.</p>

<p>There was a deep personal as well as patriotic
interest now, for Village volunteers and drafted
soldiers were overseas. All the community
mourned with the Spencers when Jeff’s name was
among the “missing” after Château-Thierry.
They looked every day for news of him, but hope
died as weeks and months passed and none came.</p>

<p>One September Saturday brought an overseas
letter for Mrs. Mallett. Dick Osborne ran to
deliver it, and then they waited for her to come
as usual and share its tidings.</p>

<p>An hour passed and she did not come. Then
she walked swiftly down The Street and passed
the post office, without turning her head. Her
face was pale and she was biting her lips to keep
them steady.</p>

<p>“It’s bad news,” they whispered one to another.</p>

<p>“Awful!” groaned Dick, as she went straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
to the pastor’s study at the back of the church.
No one knocked at that door on sermon-sacred
Saturday afternoon unless the need were extreme.</p>

<p>Mr. Harvie met her with grave, kind, questioning
eyes. “My dear Mrs. Mallett——” he
began.</p>

<p>Then she broke down and sobbed as if her
heart would break.</p>

<p>“It’s Fayett,” she said as soon as she could
speak. “He’s in hospital.”</p>

<p>“The Great Physician can heal our dear boy.
Let us——”</p>

<p>“He says he’s all right; it was a flesh wound;
he was starting back to the army. It—it isn’t
that!”</p>

<p>“Not that? Then what——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mallett again burst into tears.</p>

<p>“My dear woman, what <i>is</i> it?” asked Mr.
Harvie.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped out the awful news.
“They’ve got him; those terrible Catholics. Read—you
read for yourself.”</p>

<p>She handed him the letter and sat there sobbing
with her face buried in her apron.</p>

<p>As Mr. Harvie read Fayett’s letter, his face
cleared and he set his lips to keep back a smile.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, Mrs. Mallett,” he said gently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
“You’ve reason to be glad and proud of your son.
And I’m sure he’s just as good a Presbyterian
as when he was here in the Village Sunday school.
He——”</p>

<p>“But they’ve give him their cross; he too-ook
it!” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“It was given not as a symbol of religion, but
as a token of valor,” he explained. “Don’t you
see what he says in this sentence or two?—that
he went under fire from his refuge in a trench to
the rescue of two wounded men in a disabled
tank.”</p>

<p>“He had to help them out; they couldn’t get
away,” she said.</p>

<p>“Just so; and he saved them at the risk of his
own life. That is why this <i>Croix de Guerre</i> was
given. Fayett is a hero.”</p>

<p>“Course he is. Did they think he was a
coward?” she asked indignantly. “But he ain’t
any better’n Jack. And Jack, my little Jack, is
in this new draft.”</p>

<p>Jack’s eighteenth birthday was just past, and
so he came in the second draft that included men
between eighteen and forty-five. For the most
part, this draft, like the first one, was met frankly
and bravely. But if any one had observed carefully,
which no one seemed to be doing, he might
have found two little Village groups where sentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
seemed to drift away from the current of
loyalty.</p>

<p>One was in the shed on The Back Way where
Lincum had his cobbler’s bench. His father,
Solomon Gabe, was there oftener than formerly;
perhaps he was lonely now that his other son,
Cæsar, had been drafted for service. The old
man sat far at the back of the shed, mumbling to
himself or throwing a sharp sentence into his
son’s conversations with other negroes. They
talked in lower tones and laughed less than usual;
and when they went away, they sometimes let fall
curious misstatements and misunderstandings
about the war and the draft, like that of Emma’s,
which the white people who heard them laughed
at, tried to explain, and then forgot.</p>

<p>But one would have felt more disturbed at the
other group that lounged on the Tavern porch
on Saturday afternoons, chewing and smoking
and whittling. Mr. Charles Smith was generally
there, and the most ignorant and least public-spirited
of the men about The Village.</p>

<p>“Now what do you fellows think—” Jake Andrew
was saying fiercely one day. Mr. Smith
nudged him, Jake turned, saw Black Mayo Osborne
approaching, and concluded in an entirely
different tone, “of—of the weather?”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne laughed. “You fellows spend a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
lot of energy discussing—weather and crops,” he
said, speaking lightly but glancing keenly about
him, “Don’t you ever talk about public affairs,
this great war we are in?”</p>

<p>There was a little embarrassed silence. Mr.
Smith’s suave voice broke it. “We are poor and
hard-worker farmers, Mr. Osborne. About
crops and weather we are interested to talk. We
have not the gentleman’s time to amuse with
pretty little doves.”</p>

<p>The other men snickered or guffawed. Black
Mayo seemed about to speak, then turned on his
heel and walked away.</p>

<p>“Doves! He’ll send them to war; but he ain’t
so ready to give his folks,” said Jake Andrews,
who had done a deal of political wirepulling to
get off his drafted sons.</p>

<p>“Or himself,” growled Zack Gordan, a young
ne’er-do-well, who had made the widowed
mother who supported him an excuse for evading
war service. “What business have we got in
this war anyway? What harm have them Germans
ever done us?”</p>

<p>“Now what?” inquired Mr. Smith. He darted
a look of pure venom after Black Mayo. “That
fellow is a queer one. Can one believe he goes,
comes, comes, goes about the little birds?” He
gave a scornful, incredulous laugh. “And you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
say he had the years of absences? Where?” He
made the question big and condemning.</p>

<p>Ever since the April day that Charles Smith
had lain in the mud and looked up at Black Mayo
Osborne’s mocking face, his heart had been full
of hate. For a few weeks after the incident at
the bridge, he had been cautious, perhaps a little
fearful. But as time passed and Black Mayo
kept silence, Mr. Smith grew contemptuously
bold and missed no chance for slur and insinuation
against the man he hated.</p>

<p>And slur and insinuation were not in vain.
The community had always accepted Black
Mayo’s roving habits without question, never
surprised when he went away, welcoming him
warmly when he turned up at home a week or a
month or a year later. But now—not one of
them could have said why—they were suspicious
of those unknown weeks and months and years.</p>

<p>“And no one can question him or seek to know
his goings, for <i>he</i> is an a-ris-to-crat.” Mr.
Smith’s voice was silky.</p>

<p>Jake Andrews uttered an oath. “’Ristocrat!
I’m sick and tired of this old ’ristocrat business.
He ain’t no more’n any other man, for all his
being a Mayo and a Osborne. I’m a law officer,
and so’s my Cousin Bill at Redville. I’m going
to look into things. Seems to me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“Easy, friend!” Mr. Smith chuckled and
pulled at his fingers, making his knuckles snap
in a way he had when he was pleased. “Those
girls come.”</p>

<p>The girls were Anne and Patsy. Mrs. Osborne
had asked them to carry a basket of food to
Louviny, Lincum’s wife. He had said she had
a “misery in her back” and was “mightly porely,”
so she could not come to help about Mrs. Osborne’s
house-cleaning.</p>

<p>Anne and Patsy gave casual glances and greetings
to the group on the porch.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that Mr. Smith horrid?” said Patsy.
“I despise a man like that—with a mouth that
runs up on one cheek when he grins.”</p>

<p>“And I despise a man that’s so hateful about
Cousin Mayo—laughing about his pigeons and
saying things about his not being in the army.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Mayo used to speak so often of going;
now he never says anything about it. He looks
awfully worried.”</p>

<p>“Dear Cousin Mayo!” Anne said affectionately.
“He’s in this draft, and he may have to
go. I don’t want him not to go, but, oh, how we’d
miss him! Even when you don’t see him, you
feel The Village is a happier place to live in because
he’s here. It’s a kind of adventure to meet
him on the road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Yes,” said Patsy, “he sets your mind traveling
to all sorts of lovely, unexpected places.”</p>

<p>“Don’t his doves make you feel excited?” said
Anne. “Oh, I hope some of his birds were with
our boys fighting at St.-Mihiel. There must
have been! For Cousin Will read in the paper
that they had three thousand carrier pigeons.”</p>

<p>Chattering thus, the girls beguiled their way
to Lincum’s cabin, on the edge of the old Tolliver
place. They took a short cut across a field, and
then as they came close to the cabin they heard
loud voices and laughter that was more spiteful
than merry. They paused at the old rail fence.
There was a tangle of blackberry vines and sassafras
bushes between them and the house.</p>

<p>“That’ll be a grand day for us.”</p>

<p>They could not see the speaker, but they recognized
her voice. She was Betty Bess, a “trifling”
negro girl whom Cæsar had been “going with”
before he was drafted.</p>

<p>“You’re right, honey,” agreed Louviny. She
was bustling about, with no sign of the “misery”
that her husband said was keeping her bedrid.
She threw aside the broom and sat down in a
splint-bottomed chair. “I’ve been like old Bet
mule in de treadmill—go, go, go, an’ nuver git
nowhar. But now I’m gwine in de promised
land. I’m gwine to eat turkey an’ cake. An’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
I’m gwine to have six silk dresses an’ a rockin’-cheer.
An’ Monday mornin’ I’m gwine to put
on my blue silk dress an’ set my cheer on de porch
an’ rock—an’ rock—an’ rock!”</p>

<p>She swayed back and forth as she spoke and
her voice was shrill and jubilant.</p>

<p>“An’ Chewsday mornin’ I’m gwine to put on
my purple silk dress, an’ Wednesday my green
silk dress, an’ Thursday I’ll dress in red, an’
Friday in yaller, an’ Sat’day I’ll put on my pink
silk dress. An’ Sunday,” she concluded triumphantly,
“I’m gwine to lay out all six my silk
dresses an’ look ’em up an’ down an’ take my
ch’ice.”</p>

<p>Patsy laughed. “Did you ever hear such
foolishness?” she asked.</p>

<p>“What’s that? Who’s out thar?” queried
Betty Bess, sharply.</p>

<p>“I reckon you hearn dat old dominecky hen
a-squawkin’,” said Louviny, bringing her chair
down with a thump.</p>

<p>Patsy, followed by Anne, came out of the
thicket and went to the door.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Aunt Louviny,” said Patsy. “Lincum
said you were mighty bad off with a misery
in your back, and so mother asked us to come
to see you. But we ought to have waited till
you had on one of your six silk dresses.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>She laughed, but the woman looked confused—frightened,
Anne would have said, if that had
not been too absurd a thought.</p>

<p>“Wh-what—what you mean, Miss Patsy?”
Louviny stammered. “What—what is you
talkin’ ’bout?”</p>

<p>“About what I heard you say,” responded
Patsy.</p>

<p>“You—you ain’t hear me say nothin’—nothin’
much,” Louviny said defensively.</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, I did. I heard you say you were
tired working like a mule in a treadmill, and you
are going to have six silk dresses and a rocking-chair,”
said Patsy, laughing.</p>

<p>Louviny, still confused, looked relieved.
“Shuh, Miss Patsy! You mustn’t mind my
foolishness. I was just talkin’ ’bout what I
would do, if I had all them things.”</p>

<p>“Lincum said you were ‘mighty porely,’” said
Anne. “And so we brought you some soup and
rolls.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t deserve them,” said Patsy; “for
you aren’t sick.”</p>

<p>“Lawsy, honey! I’ve been havin’ sech a
misery in my back I couldn’t lay still, neithermore
move,” whined Louviny. “Uh, it was turrible,
turrible! I got a little easement just now, an’ I
crope out o’ bed to clean up de house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Here are the soup and rolls,” Patsy said
shortly, and she turned away.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it queer the way Louviny was talking?”
Anne said presently. “It sounds so—so
impertinent.”</p>

<p>“Um, h’m,” agreed Patsy. “She’s a trifling
thing, and made up that excuse about being sick,
to keep from working for mother.”</p>

<p>“She’s a silly thing!” laughed Anne. “Where’d
she expect to get six silk dresses? Oh, Patsy!
Let’s go by Larkland and help Cousin Mayo feed
the pigeons.”</p>

<p>This was evidently their day for appearing
where they were not expected or wanted. As
they went up the walk, they saw, through the
open front door, two men in the hall—Cousin
Mayo and a stranger, a tall, fair, youngish man.
They had only a glimpse of him, however, for
Cousin Mayo opened the parlor door, ushered
him in, and shut the door. Then Mr. Osborne
came forward to greet the girls, went with them
into the sitting room, and looked about for
Cousin Polly. He did not mention the guest
shut up in the parlor, and the girls—for the first
time at Larkland—felt themselves in the way.
They soon started home, wondering who the
stranger was.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know; I’m sure I know,” Anne exclaimed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
“It’s Kuno Kleist, Cousin Mayo’s
German friend. Fair and light-haired; he’s a
real German.”</p>

<p>“But what would he be doing here?” asked
Patsy.</p>

<p>Anne’s imagination was equal to the occasion.
“You know he’s a Socialist, and he doesn’t like
war. Cousin Mayo has brought him here to
hide, to keep the kaiser from making him be a
soldier, and he doesn’t want any one to know
he’s here.”</p>

<p>“He might have told us. We’d never let any
one know,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“Never!” Anne agreed emphatically.</p>

<p>The girls took the path by Happy Acres. If
they had gone by the mill, they would have met
Dick, who had chosen this afternoon for one of
his visits to the mine that were now rare because
of failing interest and because this year he was
heart and hand with the others in war gardening.
But there was nothing to do in the garden now,
and this was too good an outdoors day not to
go adventuring. His hopes and spirits rose with
the crisp, brilliant weather. He had found some
silver; he might find a great deal. He had as
good tools as the old blacksmith. How grand it
would be to find a big lump of solid silver! He
would buy a Liberty Bond and give a lot of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
money to the Red Cross. How all the other
boys would envy him! And the girls would know
he was “some boy!”</p>

<p>He scurried along the Old Plank Road until
he reached Mine Creek, where the path turned
off to the Old Sterling Mine. Suddenly he
stopped stock-still, listening intently. Yes, there
were voices; and coming nearer. A dozen steps
away was the tumbled-down cabin, the old blacksmith
shop. He crept into the rubbish pile—it
was little more—to wait till the people passed
by. But they did not pass. They stopped at the
creek. Dick, peeping between the logs, could see
them plainly; they were two negro men, Solomon
Gabe and his son Lincum.</p>

<p>Old Solomon Gabe, with wild, wandering eyes,
was rocking back and forth, mumbling to himself.</p>

<p>Lincum had a furtive, excited look. He was
trying to fix his father’s attention. “I told him
you knowed dat old place. Hey?” he said. “You
c’n tell him all ’bout it, can’t you? Hey? He
axed me to come wid him last night, but I wa’n’t
gwine to project on dis road in de dark, not atter
seem’ dat ha’nt so nigh here; up on dat hillside.
Um-mm! It was graveyard white; higher’n de
trees; wid gre’t big green eyes!”</p>

<p>For the first time the old man seemed to regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
what his son was saying. He chanted over his
last words: “Green eyes; gre’t green eyes; ghos’
white! Not on de hillside. Right here. I seed
it.”</p>

<p>So it was Solomon Gabe Dick had run upon
that night he was playing “ha’nt!” He had been
so startled by the sudden appearance and the old
man’s face was so distorted by terror that he had
not recognized him. Of course it was Solomon
Gabe!</p>

<p>The old negro was still speaking. “I seed it
dat fust night I come to meet dat man. Right
here. Down it went—clank-clankin’ like gallows
chains—in de groun’; right whar yore foot is.”</p>

<p>Lincum moved hastily. “I don’t like dis-here
place,” he said. “An’ I don’t like dat white man.
If de white folks ’round here finds out——Thar
he is!”</p>

<p>A man was coming down the road. It was Mr.
Smith.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said quickly. “Let’s get where
we are to go. Some one might come and see us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t nobody travel dis-here road but we-all
colored folks an’ dat venturesome Dick Osborne,”
said Lincum. “An’ don’t nobody pester
’round de place I tol’ you ’bout.”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” Mr. Smith asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“Up de hill a little piece,” replied Lincum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
“Daddy knows all ’bout it. But his mind’s
mighty roamin’ to-day. Looks like he’s done
tricked folks so much he’s gittin’ tricked hi’self.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Mr. Smith, sharply. “Here!
Come, old coon! If you want that gallon bucket
of money to open, you must do what I say.”</p>

<p>Mumbling to himself, “Money! money!
money!” the old man took the lead and went up
the path toward the Old Sterling Mine.</p>

<p>Dick came from his hiding place and crept
through the woods. The men were standing by
the mine, talking earnestly in low tones.</p>

<p>Had these negroes brought Mr. Smith here to
seek its treasure? Gallon buckets of money!
That was queer talk. He would go to Larkland
and tell Cousin Mayo what he had heard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS Dick went up the hill, he saw on the
porch a spot of blue with an expanse of
white beside it,—Mrs. Osborne in blue
gingham, with a dozen hospital shirts that she was
basting, ready for machine work.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a commotion, a frightened
fluttering and squawking among the fowls in the
side yard. Mother hens were warning their
young that a chicken hawk was near. It had
alighted in a tall locust tree, ready to pounce on
some defenseless creature. Mrs. Osborne rose
quickly, but unhurriedly, went into the house, and
reappeared in the door with an old shotgun. As
the bird poised for its downward dive, she winged
it with a quick, sure shot; it dropped in the midst
of the young things that were to have been its
prey.</p>

<p>“Whew! that was a fine shot, Cousin Polly!”
Dick said admiringly. “A hawk on the wing!”</p>

<p>“I am glad to get the rascal,” Mrs. Osborne
said quietly. “It has been raiding my poultry
yard, and I was afraid it would get some of
Mayo’s pigeons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Where’s Cousin Mayo?” Dick asked, beginning
to feel embarrassed as soon as he got over
the thrill of the hawk-shooting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne always made the boys feel clumsy
and untidy and ill at ease. She was as different
as possible from her dark, rugged, merry husband.
Everything about her was neat and prim
and small. She had a pretty little mouth, a little
thin nose, little round blue eyes; her fair glossy
hair was plaited and coiled around her small well-shaped
head.</p>

<p>“Mayo has gone away,” she answered. “He
may not come back to-night. Will you come in?
Is there any message?”</p>

<p>“No. No, thank you.”</p>

<p>And Dick made his escape.</p>

<p>After all, he was glad Cousin Mayo was not at
home and he had not yielded to the impulse to tell
the tale which would have involved the telling of
his own secret. He would watch the mine himself
and find out if Mr. Smith and the two negroes
were trying to get its treasure.</p>

<p>At the mill Dick saw the mail hack coming
from Redville and ran to get a ride. Jim
Walthall, the driver, had news to tell.</p>

<p>“Three of them drafted niggers from Charleburg
County run away from Camp Lee; deserted,
by jinks!—Bill and Martin Toole from the lower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
end of the county and Cæsar Gabe. They traced
them to a freight train, and folks think maybe
they come back here. I’ve got printed descriptions
of them, to put up at the post office. The
sheriff’s on the search for them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope he’ll find them,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“He won’t,” declared Jim. “Those fellows
wouldn’t think of coming back here where everybody
knows them; why, they’d be caught right
away. No, they’ve gone to Richmond or New
York, a city somewhere.”</p>

<p>When Dick got home Anne and Patsy were
sitting in the swing in the yard.</p>

<p>“There’s Dick! He’s been ‘secreting’ again,”
laughed Anne.</p>

<p>“I’ve just come from Larkland,” Dick said
shortly. “And at the mill I met——”</p>

<p>They stopped swinging, and interrupted him
before he could tell his news about the deserter.</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” Patsy asked excitedly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it Kuno Kleist?” demanded Anne.</p>

<p>“I just saw Cousin Polly. Cousin Mayo’s gone
away.”</p>

<p>“With Kuno Kleist, that German friend of
his, the one he was in Mexico with. He was at
Larkland. We saw him. And now Cousin
Mayo’s gone away with him and——”</p>

<p>Patsy pinched Anne’s arm. Mr. Jake Andrews<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
was coming up the walk, was, in fact, close to
them before any one saw him. On being told
that Mr. Osborne was not at home, he turned
and went away.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he heard me, and I’m awful sorry,”
Anne said. “It’s a secret, Dick, for Cousin Mayo
didn’t——” And then she told the whole story.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! What you said didn’t make any
difference,” said Dick. “Jake doesn’t know what
you were talking about; he wouldn’t care if he
did.” And then he told them about the deserters.</p>

<p>Anne and Patsy and Dick would have been
dismayed if they could have followed Jake Andrews.
He left The Village and went straight
along the Redville road to the old Tolliver place.
He gave a shrill whistle, and a minute later Mr.
Smith sauntered out of the back door toward a
clump of trees on a hillock. Andrews cut across
the field and joined him on the wooded eminence
where they were secure from observation.</p>

<p>“It’s like you said, Smittie,” declared Andrews;
“them dog-gone old ’ristocrats need
watching. Black Mayo Osborne knows a German
spy”—Smith started violently—“friends
with him, staying in his house. Them gals saw
him; that German he was with down in Mexico.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith had regained his composure. “He’s
there, you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“Gone now; that mischeevious Dick Osborne
was at Larkland after the gals was there. The
man’s gone away, and Black Mayo with him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith knit his brows. “To have known
this before! What the devil——” He looked at
Jake Andrews and adjusted his face and words.
“You have acted with the wisdom and patriotism
in coming to me. It is service to Government.
And there are rewards; much money. But it is
of the most importance that you keep cemetery
stillness.” He paused and his lips writhed and
set themselves in a hard, cruel line. Then he
said: “We shall not be surprised now to hear of
the outrages. But what happens, keep you silence
except to me.”</p>

<p>The week went by quietly, in spite of Mr.
Smith’s prediction. Black Mayo came home,
without a word about his guest or his journey,
and went here and there more busily than ever
with his pigeons for trial flights.</p>

<p>And then things did happen.</p>

<p>The Home Guard at Redville had received orders
months before to patrol the high bridge over
which troops and supplies were constantly passing
on their way to Camp Lee or to Norfolk.
Day and night the youths in khaki paced to and
fro, with guns on their shoulders. And then—what
a thrill of horror it sent through the community!—one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
of the bridge guards was killed.
The shot came from the heart of a black, rainy
night that hid the criminal. He went free, ready
to strike again—where? whom?—at any minute.
Was it one of the deserters? Probably not.
Their one aim would be to “lay low” and avoid
arrest; and probably they were far away; the
community had been thoroughly searched without
finding them.</p>

<p>A few days after the bridge guard was killed,
Sweet William came running from the mill in
great distress.</p>

<p>“It’s poisoned, mother!” sobbed the little fellow.
“There’s glass in it; the flour we were
saving for the Belgians.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, dear? What is it, Patsy?”
exclaimed Mrs. Osborne.</p>

<p>“It’s so, mother,” cried Patsy. “Oh, mother!
Cousin Giles found glass in a lot of flour. Some
one got in and put glass there, to poison it; in
our mill, our own mill here at Larkland.”</p>

<p>The finding of glass in flour at Larkland mill
was the one subject of conversation in The Village
that Saturday night. And on Sunday—a day
that in the little Presbyterian town seemed stiller
and sweeter than other days—people stood in
troubled groups at the church door, discussing
the matter. The minister even referred to it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
his prayer—not directly, that would have been
regarded as irreverent—but with the veiled
allusions considered more acceptable to the
Almighty.</p>

<p>Glass in flour at the mill, Larkland mill!
The people resented it with a vehemence that
would have puzzled outsiders. Larkland mill
was not merely a mill. It was one of the oldest,
most honored, most loyal members of the community.
As the quaint inscription on its wall
said, “This mill was finished building by Hugh
Giles Osborne his men, 8 June, in year of our
Lord 1764, ye third year of his gracious majesty
King George III.” On its oaken beams were
marks of the fire set to it by Tarleton’s men because
that Hugh Giles Osborne’s sons were fighting
side by side with Washington. Nearly a
century later, soldiers in blue marching from
Georgia had taken toll of its stores. And then
Colonel Osborne, coming back in defeat to poverty,
had laid aside his Confederate uniform and
become a miller, as his son was to-day.</p>

<p>Larkland mill had served the whole community
in peace and war, and it was loved with a personal
feeling. Had not the children even had
a birthday party in its honor at Happy Acres, not
so long ago? For it to deal out poison was like
a father’s giving it to his children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>Not that the mill was to blame. Of course not.</p>

<p>Who could have taken advantage of it and put
glass in its flour? No one could even guess.
Mr. Spotswood had not seen any suspicious
person around—only the usual frequenters of the
mill, which included all the men of the community,
white and black. The evildoer, a
stranger and an outsider of course, must have
come in the shielding twilight or the covering
night. Nothing easier. The mill was near the
highway; the doors stood wide open all day, and
shutting them at night was a mere matter of
form; there were a dozen easy ways of ingress.</p>

<p>Day after day passed and brought no trace of
the criminals. There was a growing feeling of
uneasiness throughout the community. Whispers
went about, tales circulated among the
Village loafers, the source and foundation of
which no one could give, but which were repeated,
at first doubtingly; but they were told over and
over again and gained credence with each repetition
until they were believed like gospel truth.
These tales were about Black Mayo and his guest.</p>

<p>Dick was in the back room of Mr. Blair’s store
one morning, picking over apples to pay for some
candles. He was daydreaming about the mine,
and at first was only conscious of voices in the
front room, without really hearing the conversation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
But presently he heard Mrs. Blair ask
excitedly, “Agnes, have you heard these shameful
tales about Black Mayo?”</p>

<p>Shameful tales about Cousin Mayo! Dick
listened now.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>“People are saying—— Oh, Will! tell her. I
am too furious to talk!”</p>

<p>“Jake Andrews is accusing Mayo of being disloyal,
a suspicious character that ought to be
watched, arrested.”</p>

<p>“Mayo watched, arrested! Mayo! Jake Andrews
accuses him! And, pray, who is Jake
Andrews?”</p>

<p>“A common fellow from the upper end of the
county, who schemed to keep his sons out of the
draft. This Andrews and some other fellows
went to Larkland and actually asked Mayo about
a guest of his and what his business was. Mayo
refused to tell, and when Andrews persisted,
why, he settled the matter——”</p>

<p>“‘Settled the matter,’ how?” asked Mrs.
Wilson.</p>

<p>“Knocked him down, of course. That was all
right. The idea of Andrews catechizing him!
It was infernally insolent.”</p>

<p>“I wonder he dared do it,” said Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p>“Oh! The fellow is a justice of the peace or a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
deputy sheriff or some sort of little officer,” conceded
Mr. Blair. “It seems that Andrews has
been sneaking around, watching Mayo. And he’s
found out, he claims, that Mayo has been harboring
an enemy alien, a German——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe any one at all has been there,”
said Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p>“So the thing has gone on, but——” Mr.
Blair paused and frowned.</p>

<p>“But what?” asked Mrs. Wilson.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Mayo explain?” he exploded.
“I gave him the opportunity, deuce take it! I
was so sure he would make it all right that I
brought up the subject yesterday when there was
a crowd here in the office, waiting for the mail.
But instead of saying where he went or who his
guest was—I’m a Dutchman if he didn’t walk
out of the office without a word!”</p>

<p>“And that makes it worse than if you had not
given him the chance to explain,” said Mrs.
Wilson.</p>

<p>“Of course. But I was so sure of him,” said
Mr. Blair. Then he asked impatiently: “Why
doesn’t he tell where he goes and why?”</p>

<p>“Because he doesn’t want to,” said Mrs. Blair.
“He thinks people haven’t any right to ask, and
so he won’t tell.”</p>

<p>“But he ought to tell,” said Mr. Blair. “Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
course it’s all right; we know that. But some
people—— Dog-gone it!” he said vehemently.
“I wish I had knocked Andrews down when he
came drawling his ‘suspicions’ to me. I will beat
the scoundrel to a pulp if he comes in my store
with another question. Of course Mayo’s all
right.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said his wife, more vehemently
than absolute certainty required. “I—I wonder
why—what—he wouldn’t tell you.”</p>

<p>“Whatever Black Mayo does is right,” Mrs.
Wilson said serenely. “He has some good reason
for silence.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” “Of course!” Mr. and Mrs.
Blair said, avoiding her eyes and each other’s.</p>

<p>“I know about it,” Dick thought, with a thrill
of pride. “It is all right. It was Kuno Kleist.”
Kuno Kleist! He remembered with dismay Mr.
Blair’s words, “A German, an alien enemy he’s
concealing.” Why, that was what Kuno Kleist
was, and for his Cousin Mayo to hide him was
not “all right,” in the eyes of the law, but a crime.
“They’ll never find out from me,” said Dick to
himself, gritting his teeth. “I’ll be hanged and
drawn and quartered, like men in ‘The Days of
Bruce,’ before I’ll tell anything to get Cousin
Mayo in trouble.”</p>

<p>“Black Mayo feels—oh! we know how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
feels,” said Mrs. Wilson. “But in these times
there are things we owe to ourselves, and to
others. Mayo ought to tell about his perfectly
proper journeys and perfectly proper guest, and
I am going to ask him.”</p>

<p>“Agnes!”</p>

<p>“I know. I never thought I would interfere,
would ask a question about any one’s private
affairs,” she said. “But I can’t help it. I am
going to do it. I must. Black Mayo suspected
of treason! Black Mayo that we’ve known and
loved all our lives! Why, it is as if some one
should say my Ruth was a thief.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson was not one to postpone a disagreeable
duty. She put on her bonnet and
gloves and started at once to Larkland. It was
a path familiar to her childish feet. How often
she, like her own child, had roamed about this
dear, quiet country—playing in the mill, roaming
about Larkland, fishing in Tinkling Water.
Miranda and Giles Spotswood, Anne Mayo,
Polly Spencer, Beverley Wilson, and Red and
Black Mayo Osborne had been her comrades;
Black Mayo, the leader in all their sports, was
the chum of Beverley Wilson whom she married
the very June that Black Mayo married Polly
Spencer. The friendship of early days had lasted
and deepened with the years. It was stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
than the tactful habit of never asking personal
questions.</p>

<p>She found Polly Osborne on the porch, busy,
as usual, with Red Cross sewing. She dropped
her work and set a comfortable chair in a pleasant
corner of the porch while she called greetings
to the approaching visitor. “How good of
you to brave the heat and come to see me!” she
said. “Here is a fan. Take off your bonnet.
I’ll get you a glass of raspberry vinegar. It is
so refreshing on a warm day!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson put a protesting hand on her arm.
“Don’t, Polly. I can’t sit down, not now. Where
is Mayo? I want to see him—about something
important.”</p>

<p>“Mayo? I reckon he’s in the garden. He has
some pigeons there in the old summerhouse. I’ll
find him and tell him you want to see him.”</p>

<p>“No, please, Polly. Let me go there and speak
to him. Then I will come back and see you.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; just as you wish,” said Mrs. Osborne.
“You know the way—all the ways here—as
well as I do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson went along the flagstones across
the yard, through the garden gate, down the boxwood-bordered
walk. She turned across the
huge old garden to the summerhouse embowered
in microfila and Cherokee roses, with their dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
foliage starred with creamy blossoms. She
heard a merry voice whistling “Dixie,” the only
tune that Black Mayo had ever mastered. There
he was in overalls, hard at work, putting up boxes
for nests.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mayo?” she said, speaking
before he saw her.</p>

<p>He dropped his hammer and caught both of
her hands in his.</p>

<p>“I wished you on me,” he said gleefully. “I
was thinking so hard about the rainy days when
we children used to play here! I found a box
with some of our dominoes in that closet when
I was clearing it out to make a place to keep feed
for my pigeons. Don’t you remember——”</p>

<p>“I remember everything, Mayo,” she interrupted,
with her lovely clear eyes meeting his,
“from the mud-pie days to the generous sending
of your books when mine were burned. And because
I do, I have come to ask you some questions.
Who was your guest three weeks ago? Where
did you go, on what business, when you left home
with him?”</p>

<p>He looked her straight in the eyes. “You ask,
Agnes——”</p>

<p>He hesitated and she took up his words. “I
ask, Mayo, about your private affairs”—her
voice did not falter, but her cheeks flamed—“because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
people are saying things about you that
I—we—want you to disprove.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said sharply. Then he dropped his
voice and his eyes, and answered: “I—I can’t do
it, Agnes.”</p>

<p>“Mayo!” she exclaimed. There was a little
silence. Then she said, “Oh, Mayo!” in a tone
that implored him to answer.</p>

<p>He looked away. “If you were asking me for
yourself, Agnes,” he said, “I—I ought not, but
I might—probably I should—tell you.”</p>

<p>“I do not ask for myself,” she said. “I trust
you utterly. If there were one little doubt in the
thought of my heart, I could not come to you with
this question.”</p>

<p>“A question I must leave unanswered,” he said
with a wry smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mayo!” she said. “You know I don’t
wish to force your confidence, but it seems to me
that when people ask—how dare they ask!—we
have no right to refuse to prove our loyalty.”</p>

<p>“Are they asking Giles Spotswood or Will
Blair to prove theirs?” he inquired a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“They say—you can guess what they say,
Mayo.” She could not make herself give words
to their suspicions.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” he answered quickly. “I know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
They’ve been questioning me about Kuno Kleist,
my friend in Mexico. Being a German, he was
probably a Prussian; being a Prussian, he was
probably sent by the kaiser to incite the Mexicans
against the United States; being a German and
a Prussian and the kaiser’s emissary, he probably
perverted me. Good reasoning!</p>

<p>“And they want to know about my comings
and goings. My old absent days rise up and
damn me with my dear stay-at-home county
people. And I’ve had a guest and I’ve taken a
few little trips and I haven’t put a bulletin in the
post office to say who and where and why. And
so they want me to explain. I can’t explain.”
His voice grew harsh and he laughed mirthlessly.
“Let them roll their doubts and suspicions like
sweet morsels under their tongues.” Then his
voice softened. “It was like you, Agnes, to come
to me in the spirit of our old loyal friendship, and
I thank you——”</p>

<p>She put out her hand to stop him, turning away
her head. She could not give him at that minute
the sight of her grieved face.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Mayo,” she said unsteadily. “Not
‘thanks’ between us. You—you understand why
I came. I—I am sorry——”</p>

<p>She walked slowly back across the fair, fragrant
garden, taking time to get control of herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
before she went through the gate and along the
flagged walk and around the house corner. There
was Polly on the porch, still busy with her sewing.
Mrs. Wilson compelled herself to sit down
and chat a few minutes about gardens and fowls
and Red Cross work. Then she said good-by
and started home.</p>

<p>Near the mill she met Dick Osborne and he
looked at her with eager eyes. Then his face
fell. Cousin Mayo had not told her; Dick was
sure of that as soon as he saw her face. Why
not? It must be a tremendous secret if Cousin
Mayo couldn’t tell Cousin Agnes—and she asking
him to! He remembered uneasily the conversation
that Jake Andrews had overheard; he
was sorry that fellow had happened to come along
just then. He must tell Anne and Patsy to keep
their lips glued up. Alas! It was too late now for
caution. The secret was out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“COUSIN POLLY dear,” called Anne
Lewis, tripping up the Larkland path a
few days later, “here’s the wool you said
you’d need to-day. And where is Cousin Mayo?
David wants to know if he’ll lend us a wagon
Saturday, to haul up our potatoes.”</p>

<p>“Mayo will let David know about it. He is
away from home now,” said Mrs. Osborne, in her
quiet voice.</p>

<p>“Those pigeons keep him on the go, don’t
they?” said Anne.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne answered only with a smile.
“Come, dear; sit down,” she said. “Stay to
dinner.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Cousin Polly. We want to
can a lot of butterbeans to-day,” said Anne.
“I’ll just run to the kitchen and say ‘howdy’ to
Chrissy; I haven’t seen her for a long time.”</p>

<p>Anne went to the kitchen, which, according to
Village custom, was a cabin back of the dwelling
house, and stopped at the door.</p>

<p>“Well, Chrissy, how are you?” she said pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>The old woman, usually good-humored and
talkative, turned a glum face toward her young
visitor. “Uh! I ain’t nothin’ to-day,” she
groaned. “’Scuse me a minute, Miss Anne. I
got to git a dish out de dinin’ room.” She went
out of the back kitchen door and took the long
way around to the house.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Chrissy!” Anne said when she
came back. “Why did you go that roundabout
way? Why didn’t you come out this door?”</p>

<p>Chrissy looked around, and then said in a cautious
undertone, “Miss Anne, dat doorstep’s
cunjered.”</p>

<p>“Cunjered!” laughed Anne.</p>

<p>“Cunjered,” Chrissy repeated solemnly. “Solomon
Gabe was here yestiddy. He tol’ Miss Polly
he come to bring her shoes dat Lincum patched,
but I knows better. He come grumblin’ an’
mumblin’ ’roun’ here; an’ he was puttin’ a spell
on dat step, dat’s what he was doin’.”</p>

<p>“What kind of spell?” asked Anne, still mirthful.</p>

<p>“A spell to hurt me, Miss Anne; to give me a
misery, maybe to kill me, if I tromp on it.”</p>

<p>“But I came in this door and it didn’t hurt me,”
said Anne.</p>

<p>“Naw’m. It can’t hurt you, ’cause ’twa’n’t
laid in yore name. ’Twas put dar for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Why do you think Solomon Gabe—he looks
mean enough for anything!—put a spell for
you?”</p>

<p>“He’s mad with me, Miss Anne. I—I can’t
tell you de why an’ de wherefore. Dey say de
birds o’ de air will let ’em know if I tell anything.
Miss Anne, don’t you breath what I
done said.” The old woman groaned. “Uh,
dese is trouble times, trouble times! Who is
dem folks comin’ up de walk, Miss Anne? Dey
ain’t de kind o’ folks dat come visitin’ to Larkland.”</p>

<p>Anne had joined her Cousin Polly in the hall
when the three rough, loud-talking men—Jake
Andrews, Bill Jones, and Joe Hight—came
stamping up the front steps. Mrs. Osborne met
them with the cordiality that a Virginia country
house has for any guest, even the unexpected
and unknown. Wouldn’t they come in and let
Chrissy bring them some fresh water? She was
sorry her husband was not at home.</p>

<p>“We saw him go away,” said Andrews, shortly.
“They said he was carrying pigeons to Richmond,
to fly back home.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes,” she said in a noncommittal way.</p>

<p>“Was he?” asked Andrews, fixing his beadlike
black eyes on her face.</p>

<p>Anne saw her cousin flush; the rude manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
the men was enough to bring an indignant color
to her cheeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne hesitated a minute, then said
quietly: “That is the way pigeons are trained.
They are taken away hungry, and they fly back
to the place where——”</p>

<p>Andrews cut short her explanation. “How
fast do they fly?”</p>

<p>“My husband had a bird come six hundred
miles last week,” she said. “It made that flight
in fifteen hours.”</p>

<p>“H’m! What made you think so—that it came
in that time?”</p>

<p>“Oh! my husband knows all his birds. And
there is always a note fastened to the leg, telling
where it came from and where it is going, so if
any one catches it he will turn it loose to finish
its flight.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Andrews. “If a pigeon was coming
from Richmond, it would be here now. We’ll
see if any of them have notes fastened to their
legs, to prove what you say.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne’s eyes blazed in her white face.
“What have you to do with my husband’s birds?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“What I please, with him and them,” answered
Andrews, throwing back his coat and showing a
badge. “I’m an officer of the law, I am. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
I’m dog-tired of the old ’ristocrats that been
running Charleburg County, and ain’t no better
than other folks—and friends with Germans, in
all sorts of meanness. Now, ma’am, are you
ready to prove what you said about them pigeons?”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. Mrs. Osborne’s
face went from white to red and back again. At
last she said quietly: “You need not wait, gentlemen.
No birds will come home to Larkland
to-day. There are none to come. My husband
did not take them with him.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go?” demanded Andrews.
“And who’s that strange man that’s been here
with him?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to answer your impertinent questions,”
she said, looking over his head. “Gentlemen,
I bid you good day. Come, Anne.”</p>

<p>She marched like a royal procession through
the hall, with Anne following her. They went
into the sitting room, and Mrs. Osborne, with
a red patch on each cheek, sat stiffly erect in a
straight-backed chair and talked to Anne, jumping
from one subject to another—Red Cross
work, war gardens, Mr. Tavis’s rheumatism,
Miss Fanny Morrison’s new hat—anything and
everything except the one subject she and Anne
had in mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Which of your studies do you like best?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Pigeons,” answered Anne. “Oh!” she gasped,
and hastily said, “Math,” which she hated.</p>

<p>Then, very embarrassed and puzzled and
troubled, she went back to The Village. In the
midst of her task and the merry chatter of her
companions, her thoughts wandered often to that
strange scene at Larkland. What did it, what
could it mean? There was evidently some secret;
so she must not discuss it with any one, not even
Patsy. But what? and why?</p>

<p>By the middle of the afternoon, the task they
had set themselves was finished. Anne went
home with Patsy, and they dropped down on the
shady lawn to enjoy their well-earned rest.</p>

<p>“I’m thirsty!” said Anne.</p>

<p>Patsy laughed. “That’s the first time you’ve
seemed to know what you were saying to-day!”
Then she called Emma, who brought fresh water,
and filled and refilled for them the big old
“house” dipper, a coconut shell rimmed with
silver.</p>

<p>“Oh, for some lemonade!” sighed Patsy.
“Sweet and cold, with ice tinkling in the glass!”</p>

<p>“Hush! You make me so thirsty!” said Anne.
“We could get the lemons at Cousin Will’s store,
but we ought not to use the sugar. Mr. Hoover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
says we must save more than we’ve been saving.”</p>

<p>“Dat Mr. Hoover shore is stingy wid his
sugar,” grumbled Emma. “How come folks let
him have it all, anyway?”</p>

<p>“He wants us to use less so there will be some
for our Allies,” explained Anne.</p>

<p>“H’m!” snorted Emma. “I’ve always been
havin’ all de sugar I could buy an’ pay for. Why
can’t dem ’Lies git on like dey always done?”</p>

<p>Anne knew; she had read Mr. Hoover’s appeals.
She said: “Our Allies used to get most of
their sugar from Germany and Austria, the countries
we are at war with. Now they can’t get
that, so we must divide with them the sugar from
Louisiana and Cuba and the Hawaiian Islands.”</p>

<p>“Wellum, course what you say is so; but I
don’t believe a word of it,” said Emma. “An’
here Miss M’randa come this mornin’ an’ say I
can’t have no sugar to make a cake for Sweet
William’s birthday. Um, um, um! If my old
man was livin’, he’d git sweetenin’ for dat cake
an’ for you-all’s lemonade, too.”</p>

<p>“How could he get sugar?” asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“I ain’t say sugar,” answered Emma; “I say
sweetenin’. I was talkin’ ’bout honey.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any honey,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“He’d git it, Amos would. He was a powerful
hand for findin’ bee trees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>“What is a bee tree?” “How did he find
them?” asked Patsy and Anne.</p>

<p>“Shuh, Miss Patsy! You-all know what a bee
tree is. It’s a tree whar bees home an’ lay up
honey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! But how can you find it?” inquired
Anne.</p>

<p>“My old man was a notable bee courser,” said
Emma. “Dis here’s de way he done: He put
some sirup on a chip an’ he took some flour——”</p>

<p>“Flour! What for?” interrupted Patsy.</p>

<p>“I’m a-tryin’ to tell you what for,” said Emma.
“Well’m, he’d go wid dat chip, like out yander
whar de bees is on dem white clover blooms; an’
thar he’d stand. Presen’ly de bees come an’ sip
de sirup. Whiles a bee’s a-sippin’, Amos takes
an’ dusts it wid de flour, and den he watches to
see whichaway it goes. It flies ’long home, an’
den comes back to git more sirup, an’ Amos he
takes noticement how long it’s gone; dat gives
him a sort o’ noration ’bout how fur off de tree
is. Well, he follows Mr. Dusty-back fur as he c’n
see it, an’ waits; an’ follows, an’ waits; takin’
de course twel he comes smang to de bee tree. An’
lawdy! de honey he got! We used to sell it, an’
give it ’way, an’ eat honey an’ honey cakes.
Um-mm!”</p>

<p>She smacked her lips reminiscently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>“Oh, Patsy!” said Anne, and “Oh, Anne!” said
Patsy; and then both together, “Let’s do it!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go right away!” said Anne.</p>

<p>Heat and fatigue were forgotten. They ran
into the house, and Anne scooped up a handful
of flour while Patsy was getting sirup out of a
preserve jar. They did not have enough confidence
in the amiability of the bees to put the
sirup on a chip; instead, they took a long stick,
and Patsy held it with some trepidation while
Anne stood by with the flour.</p>

<p>“Dust that big one; that big fat one!” Patsy
whispered excitedly.</p>

<p>The bee buzzed and flirted its wings, and flew
away from what must have seemed to it an
avalanche of white dust. Anne and Patsy, on
tiptoe to follow, watched eagerly to see the direction
of its flight. It circled aimlessly about, and
then buzzed back to the clover blossoms. The
girls selected another fat bee and dusted it liberally;
it flew off, buzzed about the clover field, and
came back to sip the sirup.</p>

<p>“It’s all nonsense!” Patsy said crossly. “Let’s
give up.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to give up,” said Anne. “I
reckon Amos did something Emma doesn’t know
about. I wonder——”</p>

<p>“We certainly can’t chase all the bees in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
field,” said Patsy. “We might as well be trying
to follow Dick. Come on! I want to scold Emma
for sending us on a wild-goose chase.”</p>

<p>“Wild-bee chase,” corrected Anne, laughing.</p>

<p>Patsy was too warm and tired and cross to
laugh. She went to the kitchen door and said
sharply: “Emma, what made you tell us that
foolishness about following bees to a tree?
We’ve tried it, and the bees don’t go anywhere;
they just buzz around on the clover and come
back and eat some more sirup.”</p>

<p>“Ump-mm, Miss Patsy. You just ain’t done
it right. Maybe you was coursin’ a bumbler or
de wrong kind o’ bee.”</p>

<p>“It was a honey bee. Don’t you reckon I know
honey bees?” Patsy replied indignantly. “Come
out here and I’ll show you the kind it was.
There! It was like that.”</p>

<p>“Um-hmm! Dat big fuzzy-end bee; dat’s a
droner. You’ve got to chase a honey-maker.
Thar’s one, Miss Anne; dat little fellow. Dust
it wid de flour. Now you follow it.”</p>

<p>Ah! this little creature was no loitering drone.
Instead of buzzing about the field, it took a
straight, swift course, a “bee line,” to the northeast.
Anne and Patsy followed as far as they
were sure of its course, and then waited—waited
what seemed a very, very long time, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
dusted another honey bee. A minute later, the
first flour-coated little creature came flying back,
to sip and fly away again. Again they followed,
in growing excitement and glee. It led them
across a field, through a swamp that they waded
recklessly, across another field, and into woods
where their progress was slow because they could
see only a short distance ahead. They made up
for it, however, by dusting several bees, and at
last they had a line of little messengers going in
the same direction.</p>

<p>They followed the swift-flying, busy creatures
to—of all lovely, suitable places in the world—Happy
Acres! Happy Acres, their dear garden
plot in an old field surrounded by woodland.
There was a big oak tree at the edge of that
charming, beloved place, to which bees were
coming from all directions. The girls forgot
caution and ran close to the tree; there was a hole
near the ground, and about eight feet up was a
larger hole black with bees crawling in and out.</p>

<p>“Listen, Patsy!” exclaimed Anne. “It’s humming!
the whole tree is humming like a beehive!”</p>

<p>Oh, there was no doubt of its being a bee tree!</p>

<p>They made their discovery a great sensation in
The Village. Mr. Mallett, whose father had kept
bees and who had a charm against stings, volunteered
to get the honey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The Village turned out that evening to watch
the performance.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallett set to work calmly and like a veteran.
He stopped the upper hole and started a
smoldering fire of dry leaves and tobacco stalks
near the lower opening. After the smoke stupefied
the bees, he sawed and cut the upper hole,
brushed aside the deadened bees by handfuls, and
got out the honey stored in the great hollow tree;
there were bucketfuls and bucketfuls of it. Anne
and Patsy had a happy, important time dividing
it among their friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>“They’re welcome to the honey,” laughed
Anne. “But, O Patsy! aren’t you glad you and I
had the glory of finding the bee tree?”</p>

<p>“That I am! And now hey for lemonade—cool,
and tinkly with ice, and sweet, sweet,
sweet!” rejoiced Patsy.</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! we can’t send this to the Belgians
and Frenches,” said Sweet William. “Anne, I
wish you and Patsy’d find a bee tree every week.
Then I wouldn’t mind saving all my sugar.
Emma says she’s going to make me a cake, a real
cake. And I am going to eat honey, and eat
honey, and eat honey!” He heaved a sigh of
blissful content.</p>

<p>While Anne and Patsy were coursing the bees,
Dick was on his way to the Old Sterling Mine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
He had been there several times lately, looking
about jealously to see if Mr. Smith were investigating
the mine. He had not seen any one
there again, and he had about decided that Mr.
Smith was looking over the timber in the Big
Woods and had merely stopped to see the old
mine as a curiosity.</p>

<p>And so, on this pleasant autumn afternoon,
Dick went up the hill from the creek, carefree and
whistling merrily. Suddenly his tune changed to
a sharp, dismayed exclamation, and he stopped
to gaze at the ground; yes, there were footprints;
and the tracks led—he followed swiftly and
anxiously—to the mine opening.</p>

<p>“They’ve been here! They’ve been back to my
mine!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Instead of pulling his improvised ladder from
its hiding place beside the fence, he went to the
mine hole and looked in. An old dead pine
branch was hanging on the edge; it might have
been tossed there by a gust of wind. Dick pulled
it aside. It covered a ladder made of rough timber.
Some one had been in the mine; might be
there now!</p>

<p>Dick stood very still for several minutes, listening
intently and looking sharply around. Then
he descended the ladder, with a shivery feeling
that some one might tumble a rock or send a shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
on him from above or drag him down by the legs
or thrust a knife through him from below.
Nothing happened. He descended safely, and the
tunnel ahead of him was black and silent. He
lighted his candle and went to the main room.
The odor of stale tobacco smoke hung about the
place and there were a few scraps of torn newspaper
here and there.</p>

<p>He went on toward the lower tunnel. At a
sudden little noise, he jumped and put out his
candle and stood on the alert. There was no
glimmer in the murky darkness. All was still.
The noise—if he had really heard any noise—was
probably outside, the fall of a dead bough or
the cawing of a crow.</p>

<p>He relighted his candle and went on and set
to work, but his spade made a horribly loud
noise. He felt as if some one were listening;
creeping down the tunnel; slipping behind him.
Cold chills ran over him; he peered into the darkness
outside his little circle of light; he dropped
his spade and crouched behind a projecting
rock.</p>

<p>Oh, it was useless to try to work! He put his
tools under a pile of old timbers and went back.
Just as he was starting up the ladder, he noticed
a pile of leaves between the foot of the ladder
and the wall. It was not there the last time he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
was in the mine. He kicked the leaves aside.
Under them was an old iron mortar and pestle.</p>

<p>Something in the mortar glittered in the candlelight.
Silver; silver, of course! Dick picked
up some of the particles to examine. There was a
little sharp pain and his finger began to bleed.
Why, those particles were glass! And there were
bottles and pieces of bottles. What on earth was
any one doing here with a mortar and pestle,
breaking up glass? It was the strangest, silliest,
most absurd thing! Why, what—— Oh, the
glass in the flour at Larkland mill! Had Germans,
who put that glass in the flour, been hiding
in the mine? Suppose they should come back
and find him here!</p>

<p>He hastily pushed the leaves over the mortar
and climbed out. It never entered his head then
to question how German strangers would know
of this deserted place almost forgotten by the
community. He sped down the path, through
the woods, took the path to Larkland, and hurried
to the hayfield where he saw Mr. Osborne at
work.</p>

<p>“Cousin Mayo!” Dick hardly had breath to
speak. “I’ve been in the Old Sterling Mine and
I found——”</p>

<p>“Silver!” his cousin interrupted, in humorous
excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“A mortar with broken glass in it. There were
the pestle and some bottles.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Black Mayo, the fun leaving
his face and voice.</p>

<p>“Some one had put a ladder in the hole. I
found the mortar and pestle and bottles at the
foot, covered with leaves. They weren’t there
last week. Then I went down on my ladder.”</p>

<p>“You may have got on the track of something
of far more importance than the silver in or out
of that old mine,” Mr. Osborne said, frowning
thoughtfully. “Have you seen or heard anything
else that might mean mischief, at any time?
Think! and think!”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Dick; then he exclaimed: “Oh,
Cousin Mayo! I’d forgotten, but it was queer.
The night before Broad Acres was burned, when
Sweet William was undressing, mother asked
him how he got oil on his blouse, and he said he
reckoned it was from the little smelly sticks he
got under the steps at Broad Acres. And that
night, Emma—she was standing by me—let out a
screech, ‘The devils—burning little Miss Anne!’”</p>

<p>“I wish you had told me these things before,”
said Mr. Osborne. “Now, keep a still tongue and
open eyes.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” promised Dick.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night Patsy was awakened by a
hand on her arm, an excited voice in her
ear.</p>

<p>“Patsy, Patsy!” whispered Anne. “Wake up!
I’ve something to tell you. Wake up and listen.
I can’t wait till morning. Oh, Patsy! I know
how we are going to find out Dick’s secret!”</p>

<p>“What? How?” Patsy was wide awake at
once.</p>

<p>“We’ve failed and failed; it did almost seem
as if he could outdo us. Oh, he would have held
it over our heads the rest of our lives!”</p>

<p>“But how——” interrupted Patsy.</p>

<p>“We—it came to me in a flash—we are going
to course him,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“Course him?” Patsy made the words an
amazed question.</p>

<p>“As we did the bees,” Anne explained. “We’ll
follow him as far as we can see him; and then
we’ll take up his course from that place next
time; and so on, till we get to Redville or the
end of the world—wherever he goes!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we’ll manage it,” said Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>“Oh, yes you do! Or you will when I tell you
from A, B, C to X, Y, Z,” Anne exclaimed impatiently.
“You see, Pats, we’ve got to watch
him and follow him.”</p>

<p>“We’ve tried that dozens of times,” was
Patsy’s despondent interjection.</p>

<p>“Will you listen to me? I say we’ll follow
him. He nearly always goes by Larkland, to get
a pigeon; then he comes back to the public road
and he goes up Jones’s hill. We know that, for
we’ve followed him that far. Well! Next time
we see him getting ready to go, we’ll stroll to the
mill and stop, as if we just meant to visit Cousin
Giles; then, while Dick’s at Larkland, we’ll run
along and hide in the pines where he gave us the
slip that first time. You remember?”</p>

<p>Patsy emphatically did.</p>

<p>“And then we’ll follow him. He’ll not be expecting
us there, and we’ll be careful to keep out
of recognizing distance. If he gets away, we’ll
come back home and not let him know we followed
him. And the next time, we’ll race ahead
and hide at the place where we lost sight of him,
and follow him from there.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see!” said Patsy. “We are to course
him just like the bees.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you see; at last!” laughed Anne. “Maybe
we’ll find out the very first time; or we may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
to follow him again and again. Oh, it’ll be lots
and loads of fun!”</p>

<p>The girls were on tiptoe with impatience, and
rejoiced mightily when they saw Dick put a
candle into his pocket the next Saturday afternoon.
They went at once to the mill; presently
they saw him take the path to Larkland, and they
ran ahead and dived into the pine woods where
he had hidden on that well-remembered April
day. Half an hour later, Dick came whistling
along the road, and they crept from their hiding
place and followed at a cautious distance for
about three quarters of a mile; then they lost
sight of him at a turn of the Old Plank Road.
Anne stopped.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said Patsy, keen on pursuit.
“There aren’t any paths here; of course he went
on down the road.”</p>

<p>“He may have turned off in the woods,” said
Anne. “The thing to do is to course him, follow
him as far as we see him. Oh, it’s such fun!”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” agreed Patsy. “We’ve followed
him a long way. Why, we’re over two
miles from The Village. It’s out here somewhere
in the Big Woods that Solomon Gabe lives.”</p>

<p>“Oh! the old ‘cunjer’ darky the others are so
afraid of?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“Yes. And his son Cæsar is one of the deserters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
they’re looking for. Oh, Anne! suppose
we should walk up—zip, bang!—face to face with
a real deserter?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Everybody says those men went
to New York or somewhere; they wouldn’t dare
come back here, where people know them. Now,
Pats-pet, next time Dick starts off, we’ll run
ahead and come here and—oh, Patsy! that clump
of chinquapin bushes will make a splucious hiding
place.”</p>

<p>“If he sees us, we can just be looking for chinquapins.
Anne, this was a splendid plan of
yours.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was,” agreed Anne. “Oh! I do
hope next time we’ll get there—wherever it is—and
find out Dick’s secret.”</p>

<p>A few days later, they followed Dick again.
He went toward Larkland, and they hid in the
chinquapin bushes as they had planned. And
there they stayed, weary hour after hour. No
one passed except a negro man who went slinking
down the road.</p>

<p>“Anne,” whispered Patsy, “that man looks
like—I believe it is—Cæsar!”</p>

<p>“Any darky you saw would look like Cæsar to
you, now he’s a deserter,” giggled Anne. “You
don’t see anybody that looks like Dick, do you?”</p>

<p>“No; and don’t let’s wait any longer. We’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
so crazy to find out about Dick we’re getting to be
real slackers in Red Cross and gardening.”</p>

<p>They “went by” Larkland, and there they
found Dick, busy stretching wire and driving
staples, helping Cousin Mayo wire in a new
pigeon cote.</p>

<p>The next Saturday was perfect outdoor
weather, with blue skies and crisp air that invited
one to the gorgeous October woodlands.
Early in the afternoon, Anne, who was spending
the day with Alice Blair, came running to The
Roost.</p>

<p>“Patsy! Patsy! Where’s Patsy?” she called.</p>

<p>“I sent her to carry Mrs. Hight some wool,”
said Mrs. Osborne. “She’ll be back in an hour
or so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” Anne exclaimed. “I can’t wait.
Tell her I’ve gone—she knows where—about <i>the
secret</i>. Tell her to follow to the last place,
please, Cousin Miranda. She’ll understand. I
must run.”</p>

<p>Away she sped, to pass the mill while Dick
was at Larkland and get to the chosen covert on
the Old Plank Road. Near the mill the mail
hack passed her, with passengers that excited a
sensation when they came to The Village. They
were the sheriff and a deputy with two of the
negro deserters, Bill and Martin Toole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>“Where d’you catch them?” asked Mr. Blair,
neglecting his mail bags.</p>

<p>“Not so far from you folks,” answered the
sheriff. “Lewis Jones saw two men sneaking
’round that old sawmill place in the Big Woods;
he came and told me, and Tom Robson and me
went and nabbed these fellows. We’ve brought
them here to jail to-night; to-morrow we’ll deliver
them to army folks.”</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Red Mayo Osborne came in,
hurried and anxious looking.</p>

<p>“Will,” she called to Mr. Blair, “have you seen
Anne Lewis this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“Not since directly after dinner,” he answered.
“She passed the post office then.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Osborne. “She came running
in and asked for Patsy. Patsy was away,
at the Hights’, and Anne ran off, saying Patsy
would know where she was going. As soon as
Patsy came home, she followed, but she came
back half an hour ago; she had looked and looked,
and seen no sign of Anne—on the Old Plank
Road, where she expected to find her.”</p>

<p>“Anne ought not to wander off that way,” said
Mr. Blair.</p>

<p>“Indeed not,” agreed Mrs. Osborne.</p>

<p>“I’d send the boys to look for her,” suggested
Mr. Blair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>“They’ve gone,” said Mrs. Osborne. “David
and Steve and Dick. It’s Dick that made me so
uneasy. When Patsy came back and found him
at home, she asked him where Anne was. He
said he hadn’t seen her. And Patsy said she had
followed him, as far as the Old Plank Road, she
was sure; and farther. He looked startled, positively
frightened. And he asked what color her
dress was; and when I said blue, a blue gingham,
he said, ‘Oh, I’m afraid I saw her!’ He was
off like a shot before I could ask a question. He
seemed so upset and excited that—well, it frightened
me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Miranda!” laughed Mr. Blair.
“You let your imagination run away with you.
Anne ought not to roam the woods alone, but she
is safe, perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>Dick had, as his mother said, gone hurriedly
in search of Anne. He did not share Mr. Blair’s
feeling of security; he was uneasy, alarmed.</p>

<p>On his way to the Old Sterling Mine that afternoon,
he had seen two negroes going up the path
from the creek toward the mine. He crept into
the bushes and followed a little way, but the
undergrowth was so straggling that he could not
get near them. One of the negroes was Solomon
Gabe, he was sure; the other negro, a stout,
youngish figure, had his back toward him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
was screened by bushes. Dick caught only a
word here and there of their mumbled speech—“hide,”
“get away,” and oaths and oaths.</p>

<p>He crept back to the road, and then, to avoid
Isham Baskerfield whose oxcart was going up
the hill, he went down the creek and cut through
the woods. He ran to Larkland to tell his Cousin
Mayo what he had seen and heard. The house
was shut up. Perhaps he would find Cousin
Mayo in The Village.</p>

<p>And so Dick ran home—to be greeted by the
news that Anne was off alone somewhere; had
followed him, Patsy said, along the Old Plank
Road. Then he remembered something that
filled him with vague terror; if that were Anne,
and she should wander to the Old Sterling Mine,
and encounter those men—— He turned and
ran to seek her. It was nearly dark when he
came to Isham’s cabin. The old negro was on
the porch with his wife, who was talking in a
rapid, excited voice.</p>

<p>“Hey, Unc’ Isham!” Dick called. “Have you
seen Anne?”</p>

<p>The man started and the woman was suddenly
silent.</p>

<p>Dick called again; then he sprang over the
fence and started toward the cabin.</p>

<p>Lily Belle said something sharply to Isham,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
who turned and said: “Hey? Why, it’s little
Marse Dick. Was you calling me?” and hobbled
down the path.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Miss Anne Lewis?”</p>

<p>“See who? What you say, Marse Dick?
Laws, I’m gittin’ deef!”</p>

<p>“Anne, Anne Lewis,” Dick said impatiently.
“Which way did she go?”</p>

<p>“How I know which way she go? I ain’t see
her,” mumbled Isham.</p>

<p>“What!” Dick said sharply. “I saw you going
up the road in your cart, and she was there
at the top of the hill—in a blue dress.”</p>

<p>Isham looked terribly confused. Then he said:
“Was that her? Was that Miss Anne? My old
eyes ain’t no good nowadays. I knowed somebody
passed me, but I was studyin’ ’bout my business,
an’ I ain’t took no noticement who ’twas.”</p>

<p>“But I thought she stopped and spoke to you,”
said Dick. “It looked like—— Didn’t she speak
to you?”</p>

<p>As Dick became uncertain, Isham grew positive.
“Who? Miss Anne? I don’t riccermember
her speakin’ to me. Naw, Miss Anne ain’t
spoke to me.”</p>

<p>After all, Dick was not sure it was Anne. He
had only seen a far-off figure in blue. He thought—he
was not certain—it paused by Isham’s cart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
He had not thought of Anne then, but now the
conviction grew that it was she; and he was curiously
disturbed by Isham’s manner, though he
was sure the old negro would not hurt Anne.</p>

<p>Perhaps she had gone back, straying in the
woods to get chinquapins, and was now safe at
home. Oh! surely she was at home. Twilight
was deepening. He would go home. He started
back, examining the road closely. There in the
sand were footprints, slim little tracks, Anne’s
footprints!</p>

<p>So it <i>was</i> Anne that Isham had met. Why did
he say he had not seen her? And why did he
look so confused, frightened?</p>

<p>All the tracks led in one direction. There were
no homeward-going footprints. Anne had passed
this way, but she had not gone back. Where was
she now? Did Isham know?</p>

<p>Dick ran to the cabin. No one was in sight,
and door and shutter were closed; but—for it was
now dusk—he caught glimpses of flickering firelight.
He was just about to bang on the door
when he heard a voice,—not Isham’s and not Lily
Belle’s. He peeped through a knothole. There
was a man sitting at the table. His back was
turned. Dick crept to the side of the cabin and
looked through a crack. Now Lily Belle was between
him and the man. Isham threw a lightwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
knot on the fire and the blaze flared up.
And Lily Belle moved. The man was Cæsar
Gabe, the deserter!</p>

<p>This news ought to go at once to The Village.
But Anne! He could not go back without one
effort to find her. He ran down the road to the
ford. There he stopped. After listening intently
and hearing nothing but the usual wood
noises, he took out the candle he had brought for
his mining, lighted it, and looked about. There,
on the soft, damp ground, the footprints were
distinct; and they went, not up the road, but along
the path toward the mine.</p>

<p>Dick blew out the candle, squared his shoulders,
and started up the hill. If Anne had gone to
the Old Sterling Mine, if she had encountered the
deserter—</p>

<p>Close to the mine he lighted his candle and saw
rough, heavy tracks and again that slim little
footprint.</p>

<p>Should he go into the mine to search for
her? Or should he hurry back for help—not because
of the danger to himself, but because he
only could guide aright the search for Anne; and
to tell about the deserter.</p>

<p>As he stood there, trying to decide what was
best to do, he heard—he thought he heard—a
faint cry. Anne? Was it Anne? Was she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
there, in terror, in danger? He forgot his sober
second thoughts about going back for help. Anne
there in need! He must go to her.</p>

<p>He scrambled down the ladder and stumbled
along the tunnel to the main room, not daring
to light his candle. There was no glimmer in the
darkness before him, and now he heard no sound;
perhaps he had never heard anything, had just
imagined he had. He lighted his candle and
examined the ground, but he could not distinguish
footprints, Anne’s or others. Was he
wasting precious time here, when he ought to be
on the way home to give the alarm?</p>

<p>Anyway, he would go on to the second tunnel.</p>

<p>There, about the height of his head, was something
hanging on one of the rough timbers that
supported the roofing. It was a piece of blue
ribbon, the gay bow that he had seen on Anne’s
hair. He sprang forward, in certainty and terror
now, going straight to the pit at the end of the
tunnel. He stumbled against something and almost
fell; it was the ladder that some one had
pulled out of the pit. He pushed it to the edge,
slid it in, and scrambled down.</p>

<p>As he reached the bottom, his arm was
clutched, so suddenly that his hand was jerked
upward and his candle was extinguished. For a
second he was frozen with terror, awaiting he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
knew not what—a pistol at his brow, a knife at
his throat.</p>

<p>And then to him, expecting any terrible thing,
came a dear, familiar voice. “Oh, Dick! Dick!”
gasped Anne. “I was so scared! I didn’t dare
look or move! And when I saw it was you—— Oh!
I thought no one would ever come. I thought
they were coming back to kill me!”</p>

<p>“They? Who?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. They threw a hat over my face
from behind and blindfolded me. Then they put
me here.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get away, quick as we can,” said Dick.
“I saw two men here this afternoon. That’s why
I went back.”</p>

<p>They climbed out of the pit and hurried along
the tunnel.</p>

<p>Anne giggled hysterically. “O Dick!” she said.
“I did find out your secret. I said I would, and
I did. But—I wish I hadn’t!”</p>

<p>He started to answer, and then—they were
now at the foot of the ladder—he stopped in
terror. He heard voices. The men were returning.</p>

<p>“They’ve got us,” he said.</p>

<p>“Go on, go on,” gasped Anne. “Let’s get out
anyway.”</p>

<p>“We’d just meet them,” replied Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“Oh, come on out!” Anne said desperately.
“Don’t let them kill us in this awful hole.”</p>

<p>“A hole!” Dick exclaimed. “Oh! there’s one.
Come here!”</p>

<p>He caught Anne by the arm and pulled her
along the tunnel, into the main room, to the pit
into which he had fallen on his first visit to the
mine.</p>

<p>“Here’s a hole,” he explained in a rapid whisper;
“behind this pile of dirt. Wait a sec till I
move these poles. Now! Grab that pole and slip
in. Feel for the log with your feet. There!”</p>

<p>Instead of following Anne, he poised on the
crosswise timber.</p>

<p>“Hold the candle a minute,” he said. “Quick!
And steady!”</p>

<p>He dragged back the poles he had pulled aside.</p>

<p>“Put out the light,” he said. “I’ll stay here
and watch. If they don’t step on the poles, they’ll
never find us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick! If——”</p>

<p>“Hush! They’re coming!”</p>

<p>They crouched down in silence, listening fearfully
to the footsteps and voices that came nearer
and nearer. Three men, the foremost one carrying
a lantern, stopped in the main room of the
mine. Dick saw them clearly; they were Solomon
Gabe, Cæsar, and Isham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>Solomon Gabe was moaning over and over:
“Uh, my boy! Dey’ll git you, dey’ll git you! My
boy! my boy!”</p>

<p>Cæsar spoke with impatient harshness: “Shet
up! Is all yore senses wandered off, so you can’t
see nothin’ but chain gangs an’ gallowses? I
tell you, I’m goin’ to git off. If you’d got any
spondulix from dat white man dat said he had
gallon tin buckets o’ money—— Well, I’m gwine
in dat post office to-night. I’m bleeged to have
money. Den dat daybreak train.”</p>

<p>“What you drug me here for?” asked Isham’s
frightened voice. “I got nothin’ to do wid you
an’ yore desertin’. You come to my house an’——”</p>

<p>“You reckon I was gwine to stay here an’
starve?” snarled Cæsar.</p>

<p>“An’ makin’ me tell dat lie ’bout not seein’
Miss Anne,” grumbled Isham. “When dey finds
out——”</p>

<p>“If you tell on me I’ll kill you, if it’s my last
livin’ act,” Cæsar said fiercely.</p>

<p>“Uh, I ain’t gwine to tell; I ain’t nuver gwine to
tell,” promised Isham, hastily. “But it don’t need
me. Thar’s Miss Anne. What c’n you do to——”</p>

<p>“Kill her,” said Cæsar.</p>

<p>“Uh, my boy! my boy! Trouble! trouble!”
moaned his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Cæsar! Cæsar!” Isham’s voice was shocked
and deprecating.</p>

<p>“Killin’ is saftest,” insisted Cæsar. “If you-all’s
feered, leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“Naw! naw!” protested Isham. “Boy, if you
do a killin’—— I know dese here white mens.
Dey’re mighty soft an’ easy-goin’ long as you
don’t make ’em mad. But if harm comes to dat
gal, dey’ll grub thar way down to hell wid thar
bare hands to git de man dat done it. You’ll
nuver git away. I—I’ve heerd bloodhounds
run,” he quavered.</p>

<p>Cæsar cowered. “You want to turn her loose,
to start a search an’ git me cotch?” he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>“Naw. Just left her in dat hole awhile,” said
Isham. “She don’t know yore name or nomernation.
An’ ’fore folks find her, you’ll be gone.”</p>

<p>Cæsar thought it over. “Well,” he agreed. “If
she stays thar two-three days—— Le’s take a
look ’round to make shore thar ain’t no way she
c’n climb out.”</p>

<p>“Thar wa’n’t nothin’ but de ladder, an’ you
done took it out,” said Isham.</p>

<p>“Le’s make shore. If she come here to de
openin’, folks mought hear her.”</p>

<p>Cæsar, followed by Isham and Solomon Gabe,
went down the tunnel toward the pit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>Anne clutched Dick’s arm. “They’ll miss me
and find us here,” she whispered. “Let’s get out.
Let’s run.”</p>

<p>“Too near. Not time enough. Sh-sh!” Dick
answered hurriedly.</p>

<p>Even then the negroes were coming back, in
great excitement.</p>

<p>“Who put dat ladder thar? Who got her out?”
Isham was saying wildly over and over.</p>

<p>“Come on!” Cæsar was urging, between oaths.
“We got to ketch her ’fore she gits to de Village.
Hit’s her life now; or mine!”</p>

<p>“Yas, yas! An’ I’ll stan’ by you!” Old Solomon
Gabe ended with an awful, sobbing shriek.</p>

<p>Anne and Dick, cowering in the hole, felt as if
wild, bloodthirsty beasts were on their trail. The
fierce voices, the hurrying feet were close at hand.
But they passed by. They went toward the
ladder. And then voices and footsteps died away
in the distance.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the voices died away, Dick sprang up and
pushed aside the poles.</p>

<p>“Come on, Anne!” he said. “Here!
Take my hand. Now! We must get home—quick!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick! What if they come back? What
if we meet them?”</p>

<p>“We’ll not meet them,” he answered. “They’re
going to The Village, looking for you. And he’s
planning to rob the post office. He may shoot
Cousin Will. We must hurry and let them know
at home.”</p>

<p>He took Anne’s hand and they groped through
the tunnel and into the mine opening.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s night!” Anne whispered.</p>

<p>“Late,” said Dick. “It was dark when I came.
The moon’s up.”</p>

<p>They crept up the ladder. Dick put his hand
on Anne’s arm and they stood still a minute,
straining their eyes and ears into the woodland
night. Above the whir and chirp of insects and
the murmur of the little stream, they heard a
trampling on the hillside; no voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“Suppose just Cæsar and Isham have gone
on?” whispered Anne, terrified. “Suppose that
awful old man is waiting to grab us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Dick tried to soothe her; then he
warned her: “Don’t talk. Listen. And be on
the lookout.”</p>

<p>They went cautiously down the path, starting
whenever a twig cracked or a pebble rolled underfoot.
Now and then they stopped to listen and
peer ahead. Thus they went on—across the
creek, along the path, on the Old Plank Road, up
the hill by Isham’s cabin.</p>

<p>The door was open, and by the brilliant blaze
of the lightwood knots on the hearth Anne and
Dick saw Lily Belle moving restlessly about. She
came to the door and peered out; but she did not
see the two figures that slipped past in the darkness
and hurried along the Old Plank Road to the
highway.</p>

<p>At the path that turned off to the mill and Larkland,
Anne caught Dick by the arm. “Wait,
Dick!” she said.</p>

<p>“We haven’t time to stop,” he said impatiently.
“Come on!”</p>

<p>“But, Dick,” she said, “I’ve been thinking—— Suppose
they’re watching. If we go the straight
road home, they’ll be sure to catch us.”</p>

<p>“It’s a chance we’ve got to take, to get home to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
tell them,” he said. “I must. Do you want
to——”</p>

<p>“If we turn off here and go to Larkland,” said
Anne, “we can tell Cousin Mayo. He’ll know
what to do. It isn’t much farther this way, and
it’s a million times safer.”</p>

<p>“Righto!” agreed Dick, turning into the path.
“I’d been wondering if we’d get past them.”</p>

<p>They hurried along the path through the woods
and splashed through Tinkling Water, not taking
time to grope for the stepping-stones. The mill
loomed before them, a huge, dark shadow on
the shadows.</p>

<p>Dick and Anne ran along the road to Larkland.
Presently they heard horse’s hoofs clattering
down the road. There was a pause at the
big gate, and a familiar voice said, “Steady,
Rosinante, steady!” as the rider bent to open the
gate.</p>

<p>“Cousin Mayo! Cousin Mayo!” cried Dick
and Anne, running toward him.</p>

<p>“Hey! Who’s there?” he called sharply.</p>

<p>“It’s just us,” said Anne; and Dick said,
“Anne and me.”</p>

<p>“Anne!—here at this time of night! Why,
everybody in The Village is distracted about you.
Get on Rosinante behind me. I’ll take you to The
Roost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Cousin Mayo——”</p>

<p>“Who’s that with you? Dick? Is this one of
your fool pranks?”</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne’s indignation for the instant
dominated his relief. The search for Anne had
been growing hourly in intensity and uneasiness.
After walking about for hours, he had come
home to get his horse, and was starting off again.
And here the girl for whom the community was
searching came strolling up the road to Larkland.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“We were afraid to go home,” said Anne.
“They are looking for me.”</p>

<p>“Of course we are looking for you,” Black
Mayo said impatiently. “They are horribly uneasy
about you.”</p>

<p>“I mean, Cæsar’s looking for me,” Anne explained
in a hurried, scared undertone. “The deserter!”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“They put her in the Old Sterling Mine. I
found her,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“We thought we’d better tell you about it. I
ran up on that deserter, and he’s afraid I’d tell.
They’re looking for me, and—— Oh! what’s
that?” Anne gave a stifled cry. The noise
that she heard was only—as she realized on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
instant—the crackling fall of a dead bough, but
it left her white and quivering.</p>

<p>“Here, here!” said Black Mayo. “Let’s know
what this is all about.”</p>

<p>He sprang from his horse, threw the bridle
rein over the gatepost, and led Anne up the walk
and into the house.</p>

<p>“Why, Mayo! I thought you were gone.
Anne! Where did you find her, Mayo? And
what is the matter?” asked Mrs. Osborne, as they
hurried into the room where she was sitting.</p>

<p>There was no direct answer to her questions.
Mr. Osborne put Anne in a big chair and knelt
down before her, grasping her cold, trembling
hands. “Tell me what happened. Quick!” he
commanded.</p>

<p>“I feel as if they are peeping in,” Anne said
with a shuddering glance at the windows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne drew the curtains close, and she
and her husband listened with exclamations and
quick questions to the girl’s story. As Mr. Osborne
listened and questioned he was moving
about—taking firearms out of a closet, loading a
gun with buckshot, oiling and loading a revolver,
getting out boxes of shells and cartridges.</p>

<p>“They didn’t see you,” he said; “they don’t
know where you are—or you wouldn’t be here.
Polly, you and Anne and Dick go into the chimney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
room——” He nodded toward a small room
opening out of the sitting room, and called “the
chimney room” because it was only the width of
the big old chimney. “Fasten the shutters; nail
down the window and put a blanket over it, so
that not a ray of light can get out. Leave the
door ajar and a dim light in the sitting room, so
you can see both doors. Don’t answer any call
unless it’s my voice.”</p>

<p>“Your voice? You are going——”</p>

<p>“To The Village. To warn Will and help there.
If any one enters the house, keep still till they
open the sitting-room door, and then aim straight
and shoot to kill, Polly, as you do at the chicken
hawks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mayo; I will.” Her voice was as calm
as if she were answering a request to sew on a
button. With an unfaltering hand she took the
gun she was accustomed to use with deadly execution
on birds of prey.</p>

<p>“God bless you, dear!” Her husband took her
in his arms and kissed her still, colorless face
again and again. “Dick,” he said, “keep the gun
and pistol loaded for your Cousin Polly. She’s
better than the best man I know, in time of need.”</p>

<p>He turned to go.</p>

<p>“But, Mayo,” said his wife. “You must have
firearms. Take a gun, the pistol.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“No,” he said. “If that villain traces Anne
here, you’ll need firearms. Anyway, the pistol
would be mighty little use to me; I’d be an easy
mark—on horseback, for them sneaking along in
the dark. But I count on getting safe to The Village.
They aren’t after me, you know. And
what’s a man’s life for but to take in his two
hands and put where it is needed?” He unclasped
her hands that clung to him. “If all goes
well, I’ll be back—— Oh! as soon as I can come.”</p>

<p>He went out unarmed into the hostile night.
The tense listeners heard his firm, light tread on
the flagged walk, the restive mare’s whinny, and
his soothing, “Whoa there! Gently, girl!” Then
he galloped down the hill, whistling “Dixie.”</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed. Anne tumbled down
on the bed, to rest a while, and Dick, too, fell
asleep. Mrs. Osborne sat there alone, very still
and heedful, with the firearms at her hand.</p>

<p>Once the collie sleeping on the porch gave a
quick, short bark, yelping in a dream or at some
little meaningless noise. Mrs. Osborne’s face
brightened. “Mayo!” she breathed, bending to
listen. But no horse hoofs rang on the road, no
footsteps sounded on the walk; and gradually the
light faded from her face, leaving it bleak and
sharp.</p>

<p>At last the early-morning farm noises began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
to be heard. Roosters crowed, a restless calf
bawled and was answered by its lowing mother,
the collie whined and scratched at the door. The
east lightened for dawn. The gray sky became
saffron and brightened to orange. Catbirds and
thrushes sang, wrens twittered and crows cawed.
There was the sweet, melancholy sound of cooing
doves. Then came the pause when day seems to
“stand tiptoe.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne went into the sitting room. She
looked through the front window, down the road;
quiet and untraveled, it lay there in the brightening
morning light.</p>

<p>“If nothing had happened,” she said to herself;
“if he were safe——”</p>

<p>She turned from the window, with her lips
pressed tightly together.</p>

<p>Now sunrays were creeping through the eastern
shutters, and the farm creatures were growing
insistent in their calls. Mrs. Osborne
wakened Anne and Dick, who were amazed and
mortified to find that they had slept so long and
left her to watch alone.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s day, broad day!” exclaimed Anne.
“Hasn’t Cousin Mayo come back?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that queer? I should think he’d be
here,” said Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>He and Anne ran to look out of the window,
but Mrs. Osborne sat silent, with averted face.</p>

<p>“You look so tired, Cousin Polly!” said Anne.
“Do lie down a little while. We’ll watch.”</p>

<p>“No,” Mrs. Osborne said quietly. “I am not
tired. I must go out and feed the stock, and the
pigeons.”</p>

<p>“Let me do it,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“We’ll help you,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“No. You mustn’t go outdoors and risk being
seen. I’ll be back in a little while.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne made the rounds of the farmyard.
Last of all, she carried a bucketful of
small grain to the pigeon cote, and scattered it
on the ground. The pretty, gentle birds fluttered
around her and alighted on her arms and shoulders.
She stroked the shining plumage of one
of her husband’s pets. Then her lips quivered
and she dropped her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“God help me!” she said. “If he were alive,
he would have come back to me.”</p>

<p>A few painful tears trickled between her fingers.
But soon she regained her self-control
and went indoors.</p>

<p>“Anne, Dick,” she said, “if something had not
happened, Mayo would have been back. I’ve
stayed here all these hours because he said we
must. Now I’m going to look for him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“And we are going with you,” Anne exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Osborne considered a minute. “You’ll
be just as safe, I reckon,” she said. “Come on.”</p>

<p>Dick ran ahead and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Polly!” he cried. “There are
people—two men—coming up the hill. It’s
father and——”</p>

<p>“Cousin Giles!” said Anne.</p>

<p>She and Dick ran down the path, followed
more slowly by Mrs. Osborne. She did not even
hope to see her husband again, and it was with
calm misery that she met Red Mayo and Giles
Spotswood. At least she would have certainty
instead of the terrible suspense of these long
hours.</p>

<p>Red Mayo Osborne ran forward and threw
his arms around his son and Anne, and kissed
first one and then the other.</p>

<p>“Dick, my boy! Anne, dear little Anne!
Thank God, you are safe!” exclaimed Red Mayo.
“Mayo said you were safe with Polly.”</p>

<p>“Where is Cousin Mayo?” asked Anne.
“We’ve been looking and looking for him to come
back.”</p>

<p>Red Mayo glanced away. He answered in a
queer, hesitating voice. “He—he couldn’t come
now.”</p>

<p>Polly Osborne’s face was as pale as death and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
drawn with anguish. Red Mayo, keeping his eyes
still averted, did not see it. She spoke in a firm,
low voice: “What about Mayo?”</p>

<p>“The fact is,” Mr. Spotswood said, “Mayo—he
told me to tell you, Polly—Mayo—Mayo has
been arrested.”</p>

<p>“Arrested!” she repeated blankly.</p>

<p>“Arrested,” Red Mayo said. “Jake Andrews
came with a warrant. Arrested as—as a pro-German,
or something. But—he ran away.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Anne, in amazement.</p>

<p>By degrees they got the story. Mr. Osborne
had ridden to The Village, without seeing Cæsar
or Solomon Gabe or Isham. He quickly told his
tale to the men who were waiting for him to start
an organized search for Anne; had she and Dick
reached Larkland a few minutes later, the deserter
would have found all the Villagers away in
search of Anne, and the post office would have
been easily rifled. As it was, the Village men
hid in the post office and waited till Cæsar came
through a window and seized him. Only one of
the older negroes, probably Solomon Gabe, came
with Cæsar to The Village; he stayed outside the
office, and ran away when the fracas began inside.
They sent a few shots after him in the
darkness, but evidently without effect.</p>

<p>They carried Cæsar to the jail and locked him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
in a cell, to await the officer who was to take him
back to Camp Lee.</p>

<p>And then in the early morning, just as Black
Mayo was starting home, Jake Andrews rode up
The Street.</p>

<p>“Huh! You’re the man I’m looking for,” he
said to Black Mayo, without any courtesies of
greeting. “I was on my way to your house.”</p>

<p>Black Mayo looked him up and down, without
speaking.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a warrant for your arrest,” Andrews
said, producing a paper.</p>

<p>“My arrest! On what charge, pray?”</p>

<p>“Oh, there are charges enough; having traitors
in your house, and being one yourself likely,
and——”</p>

<p>“Who preferred these charges against me?”
inquired Mr. Osborne.</p>

<p>“A good citizen, if he ain’t none of you-all’s
aristocrats. You’ll find out who and what when
your trial comes.”</p>

<p>A dozen voices rose in protest.</p>

<p>“That’s high-handed!”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Jake! There’s a mistake somewhere.
Why, we all know Mayo Osborne. He’s
all right.”</p>

<p>“I know my duty, and I’ve got my warrant,”
Andrews responded doggedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>Mayo Osborne looked perplexed. “We’ve got
to submit to law and officers,” he said, “Red,
you and Giles go to Larkland, please—Polly’ll
be uneasy—and tell her about this arrest business—”
He laughed—“and get Anne and Dick.”</p>

<p>“We’re going to stand by you, you know,
Mayo,” said Red Mayo. “We know it wasn’t—wasn’t
an intentional crime. It was perfectly
natural you should not consider that your old
friend was an enemy alien and that you should
shelter Kuno Kleist——”</p>

<p>“Kuno Kleist! What do you mean?” demanded
Black Mayo.</p>

<p>“He was—wasn’t he?—the man who visited
you secretly, who——”</p>

<p>“That tall, fair man with a little pointed beard.
If he wasn’t Kuno Kleist, who was he?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. I submit to arrest. But, Mr.
Law Officer, will you explain why you are such
an early bird, out at daybreak?”</p>

<p>“I’m on my job,” replied Andrews. “A good
citizen came to me in the night and said you were
fixing to skip the country and——”</p>

<p>Black Mayo considered this with a frown.
Suddenly he gave a startled exclamation.
“Charles Smith told you that?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes; he——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>“That express! Redville at seven-thirty!” exclaimed
Black Mayo.</p>

<p>Before any one had the ghost of an idea what
he was going to do, he was out of the group, at
the horse rack where Rosinante was tied, on her
back, and galloped down the road. Andrews
with an oath, jumped on his horse and pounded
after him.</p>

<p>Without a word, the little group watched the
fleeing and the pursuing man till they were out of
sight. Then they looked around at one another.</p>

<p>“What on earth’s the meaning of it all?” Will
Blair asked everybody.</p>

<p>No one tried to answer.</p>

<p>But David Spotswood said: “I know two
things: Cousin Mayo’s all right, and Jake Andrews
will never catch him.”</p>

<p>Red Mayo laughed. “Never! As Emma would
say, he might as well try to plant a rose bush on
the tail of a comet. Well, we must go and tell
Polly.” And then his face grew sober.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BLACK MAYO did not spare his good horse,
but the train whistled long before he
reached Redville, and a desperate spurt of
speed only brought him to the station as the train
was pulling out. He flung himself off Rosinante
and ran down the platform—just too late to
clutch the rear railing of the last coach.</p>

<p>There was no one in sight; the station agent
did not meet this early train, and the telegraph
office would not be open for another hour.</p>

<p>Mr. Osborne stood a moment, looking after the
departing train. Then, frowning, he got on
Rosinante and rode slowly homeward. Half a
mile from the station he met Jake Andrews,
coming on merely because he had started, and
much surprised at seeing the fugitive whom he
had long ago given up hopes of overtaking.</p>

<p>“Andrews,” Mr. Osborne said crisply, “come
with me to Smith’s place. We must make certain——”</p>

<p>“Come with you!” Andrews recovered himself
enough to sneer. “You’ll come with me,
under arrest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>“Nonsense, man!” Black Mayo threw open
his coat and displayed a badge that made Andrews
stare. “Don’t make yourself a bigger
laughingstock than you’re bound to be when
people find out you let yourself be that scoundrel’s
tool.”</p>

<p>“Wh-what do you mean, Mr. Mayo?” stammered
Andrews.</p>

<p>“Come and find out,” commanded Mr. Osborne.</p>

<p>Down the road they met a party of horsemen;
Mr. Tavis, Mr. Blair—oh! the whole Village, astonished
at Black Mayo’s arrest, was following
after, hoping to have the mystery explained.</p>

<p>But for the moment Black Mayo made no explanation.</p>

<p>“Come!” he said, hurrying on to the old Tolliver
place.</p>

<p>Albert Smith came out to meet them. His eyelids
were red, and he looked lonesome and miserable,
but he met Mr. Osborne’s eyes bravely and
frankly answered his questions. His uncle had
gone away very early that morning.</p>

<p>“Exit Karl Schmidt, alias Charles Smith, German
propagandist, bridge destroyer, et cetera!”
said Black Mayo, looking around at his companions.</p>

<p>There was a chorus of surprised exclamations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>“Where has he gone?” thundered Andrews,
turning to Albert.</p>

<p>“I do not know, I do not want to know. I have
nothing to tell you about my uncle,” the boy
answered in a low, firm voice.</p>

<p>“You’d better—”</p>

<p>“Stop that!” Black Mayo checked Andrews’
blustering, and put a protecting hand on Albert’s
shoulder. “But what are you to do, my boy?”</p>

<p>Albert’s lip quivered. “My uncle said I might
go to our cousin in New York. But I do not
want that. I like it here. I like to study and war-garden
and help liberty. I want to be American.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can make plans later,” Mr. Osborne
said kindly. “Now get your horse and
come home with me and let’s have our breakfast.”</p>

<p>Albert went to the stable, watched suspiciously
by Jake Andrews, who began a mumbling which
Black Mayo interrupted. “Oh, I forgot! Mr.
Andrews has a warrant to serve against me.
Shall we——”</p>

<p>Andrews, turning fiery red, jerked out his warrant
and tore it in two. “And I let that man make
a fool of me!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Black Mayo agreed tranquilly.</p>

<p>“But if you knew all this—you had authority,
being a Secret Service man—why didn’t you arrest
him?” demanded Andrews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>“Because there were things we wanted to find
out, details of a plot, proof against its leaders. I
don’t mind telling now—you’re an officer of the
law and these others are friends—the tall, fair
man who came to Larkland was Thomas Milner.
You’ve heard of him?”</p>

<p>“Not the big Secret Service chap?” exclaimed
Andrews.</p>

<p>“Yes. I was in Washington, to make a report
to him, when Smith sent you fellows to Larkland
to nose about.”</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Osborne had told me——” Andrews
began to mumble.</p>

<p>“She didn’t know; and she wouldn’t have told
you if she had known.”</p>

<p>“But why did Smith set us on you?”</p>

<p>“Oh! partly revenge for a beating I gave him
last year and a fracas we had later, and partly,
no doubt, to shield himself from suspicion by
turning it on me and my guest. If he had suspected
who that guest was——” Black Mayo
chuckled.</p>

<p>“But what was Smith doing?” asked Mr. Blair.</p>

<p>“This little out-of-the-way corner was a good
place for him to lie quiet between jobs. He didn’t
do much right here except some mischief-making
among foolish negroes and silly whites.”
Jake Andrews reddened, but Mr. Osborne did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
not look at him. “Instead of being a chewing-gum
salesman, as he pretended, Smith had a nice
little business of directing bomb throwers. He
got plans of all the railroad bridges in this section,
with a view to their destruction, so as to
hinder troop movements. The high bridge was
such a tempting mark that he wanted a whack
at it himself, preferably with a troop train on it.
I found out that just in time.</p>

<p>“Now, Andrews, you’d better go to Redville;
the telegraph office will be open. Mr. Jones
comes down on that 8.45 train, and he must wire
up and down the road, and see that Smith is arrested.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do whatever you say, Mr. Osborne,” Andrews
said humbly.</p>

<p>“Here comes Albert. Well, folks, let’s go
home. A fine morning for an early ride.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a glorious day, early November
in Southside Virginia. The sunshine lighted
up the bright gold of hickory and the pale gold
of down-fluttering locust leaves and the tawny
purple of black haw and the rich or flaming reds
of oaks and Virginia creeper, all the more splendid
against the steadfast green of pines.</p>

<p>“Our woods look like an army with banners,”
said Black Mayo. “Banners of victory! It’s at
hand,” he said confidently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>Ever since Château-Thierry, the Allies had
been on the offensive. The <i>mittel-Europa</i> dream
of Germany faded as Bulgaria and Turkey and
Austria-Hungary fell. Only Germany was left
now. And all the world, and none better than
the kaiser and Von Hindenburg and Ludendorff,
knew that she soon must yield. “Retreat! retreat!
retreat!” was the one order. Never again,
“Forward!”</p>

<p>The victory news came two days later. David
had ridden to Redville for the daily <i>Dispatch</i>, and
he came galloping up The Street, waving a paper
that had a big black headline:</p>

<p>“ARMISTICE SIGNED!”</p>

<p>The President had gone before Congress and
given it the great tidings. “My fellow countrymen:
The armistice was signed this morning.
Everything for which America fought has been
accomplished. The war thus comes to an end.”</p>

<p>For over four years Europe had been a battlefield
for the nations of the world. The conflict
was less between nations than between two principles:
The right of kings to govern through
armies, and the right of people to govern themselves
by law and justice. When the fate of the
world seemed in doubt, America turned the scale
for right and justice.</p>

<p>A day or two after the great armistice news,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
Black Mayo went with the Village young folks
to the Old Sterling Mine; they were all curious to
see the scene of Anne and Dick’s perilous adventure.</p>

<p>“I wish Albert had come with us,” said David.</p>

<p>“He preferred to stay at home,” said Mr. Osborne.
“Naturally he feels badly about his
uncle’s arrest; the fellow’ll probably have a long
term in a federal prison.”</p>

<p>“What’ll become of Albert?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll get on all right. He’s a good little
American,” replied Mr. Osborne. He did not
say that he and his wife were planning to adopt
the little fellow who had endeared himself to them
both.</p>

<p>“Our boys will be coming back soon,” rejoiced
David.</p>

<p>“Those who are left of them,” Anne said
soberly.</p>

<p>Alas! there was a gold star for Mrs. Hight’s
son William, and Jeff Spencer was still missing.
But the other Village boys would have honorable
discharges, and Fayett Mallett was bringing
back a <i>Croix de Guerre</i>.</p>

<p>“If only I had been older——” David began
enviously.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mr. Osborne said, “I wanted to go,
too, but if I had and we had lost our bridge and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
perhaps a trainload of soldiers or supplies—— Ah,
David, we stay-at-homes can look our soldier
boys in the face and say, ‘We, too, did our
part.’ Those brave fellows over there would
have been helpless if we here hadn’t been brave
enough to do our duty.”</p>

<p>Anne had been walking quietly along beside
Mr. Osborne. Now she said in an undertone,
“Cousin Mayo, I——” Then she stopped.</p>

<p>“Well, Anne?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Mayo, I—I——” Then she blurted
out, “I was to blame about their thinking—about
your arrest.”</p>

<p>“You to blame? Of course not!”</p>

<p>“The stranger I saw at Larkland that morning—I
thought—I said it was Kuno Kleist. And
Jake Andrews heard me.”</p>

<p>“It was Mr. Milner. As I did not present you
to him, you ought not to have mentioned him or
guessed his name. The lips of an honorable guest
are sealed to the secrets of a house.” Mr. Osborne
spoke gravely; The Village had its standard
of good breeding not to be lowered for its young
people; they must rise to it.</p>

<p>“Yes, Cousin Mayo,” said Anne. “I’m awful
sorry. I was so excited, thinking it was Kuno
Kleist.”</p>

<p>“I thought so, too,” said Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“You will never see Kuno, my dears,” Mr. Osborne
said sadly. “He is dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p>“Murdered. His sister wrote to me from
Switzerland. He came home once on a furlough,
and she asked him if the tales were true about
brutalities to conquered people. He said: ‘I hope
those things will not be required of me; I am a
human being before I am a German.’</p>

<p>“A month later came the news that he had
been shot for refusing to obey orders. She
learned the details later from a comrade. An old
Frenchman had fired on a drunken German soldier
who insulted his daughter, and Kuno was
one of a squad ordered to shoot a dozen citizens
in retaliation—men and women and children
drawn by lot. Kuno refused. He was put in
front of the firing squad and was shot by his
own comrades.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry,” Anne said softly.</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” Black Mayo said, with a tender
smile. “Death was his only gate to freedom from
the wicked tyranny of Prussia.”</p>

<p>“Old Prussia’s beat at last, thanks be!” said
Patsy. “What will the Allies do to the Germans,
Cousin Mayo?”</p>

<p>“Say to them, as Julius Cæsar said to the Germans
two thousand years ago: ‘Go back whence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
you came, repair the damage you have done, and
give hostages to keep the peace for the future!’”</p>

<p>“Peace!” said Anne. “Your doves are birds
of peace now, Cousin Mayo.”</p>

<p>“And again they find a deluged world.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sound gladder, Cousin Mayo!” cried Dick.
“We’ve won the war; and—thanks to Albert and
me helping this year—we walloped the girls in
garden work and took the silver cup. Oh, it’s a
fine old world!” He danced a jig on the roadside.</p>

<p>His cousin smiled in sympathy. “I don’t want
to be a wet blanket, young uns,” he said. “We
did splendid work in war. When I look ahead,
I see such stupendous peace tasks that—well, it
makes me solemn. Oh, well! we’ll grope and
stumble a little, but we are on an upward path,
with old ideals and new vision ahead of us—and
thank God for the leader with vision.”</p>

<p>This talk brought them to the top of the long
hill that led to Mine Creek.</p>

<p>“There’s Unc’ Isham’s cabin, still as a graveyard,”
remarked Dick. “I wonder where he and
Aunt Lily Belle are?”</p>

<p>“They ran away because they’re scared of being
punished,” said Steve.</p>

<p>“They’d better be scared; mean things!” exclaimed
Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Oh! Unc’ Isham didn’t want to hurt me,” said
Anne. “He was just afraid to tell where I was.
It was mighty comforting to hear the way he
talked.”</p>

<p>“I say it was!” Dick agreed emphatically.
“The old nig was in a tight place, with Cæsar
threatening to kill him.”</p>

<p>“And there’s Solomon Gabe’s house,” said
David.</p>

<p>The door was open; but the house was a mere
shell from which its occupant had gone forever.
When his son was captured, the half-crazed old
negro had rushed back to his poor little home
and, overcome by haste and terror, he had fallen
dead on the threshold. There the officers of the
law had found him.</p>

<p>“It was Solomon Gabe—poor old misguided
wretch!—who set fire to Broad Acres,” said Mr.
Osborne.</p>

<p>“What! Did he burn Broad Acres?” exclaimed
Patsy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Mayo! How do you know?”
asked Alice.</p>

<p>“Dick heard Emma say that night that ‘the
old devil was burning little Miss Anne.’ At first
I couldn’t get anything out of her; she insisted it
was Satan she meant. But, now that Solomon
Gabe is dead, she confesses that he told her the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
night before not to let Mary Jane sleep at Broad
Acres; ‘the torch of the Lord was lit for that
house.’ She kept her daughter at home; and then
she was afraid to tell, partly for fear of being
blamed herself and still more from fear of Solomon
Gabe. I’m pretty sure he put the glass in the
flour at Larkland. He was at the mill that day,
I remember.”</p>

<p>“Do you reckon any of the other darkies knew
about it?” asked Anne.</p>

<p>“They probably knew a little and suspected
more; like Emma they were afraid to tell.”</p>

<p>“Louviny talked mighty queer one day when
Patsy and I were there,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“Smith had made all sorts of promises and
threats to her and Lincum,” said Mr. Osborne.
“When Kit destroyed the war gardens, he was
merely acting in the spirit of what he heard at
home. Scalawag told us about that; didn’t he,
Billy boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sirree!” said Sweet William, waggling
his head proudly. “Hasn’t anybody helped war
gardens more than me and Scalawag.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Anne! Here’s where I found
your footprints, turning from the road up to the
path,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“I saw somebody through the bushes; I thought
it was you, and I followed, down that ladder; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
then that man—I didn’t know who he was—pushed
me in the pit and pulled out the ladder.
Oh, Dick! here’s where I thought they had us, on
the way out. I stepped on a twig, and it snapped—like
a pistol shot it sounded.” Anne shuddered
at the memory.</p>

<p>“What—who’s that?” Dick exclaimed, looking
earnestly into the woods at the left.</p>

<p>“Nothing; nobody,” David said carelessly.
“Well, here’s your mine hole, with the ladder in
it still.”</p>

<p>They all went into the mine and examined it
with a great deal of interest, especially the hole
in which Anne and Dick had hidden. Black Mayo
lingered there after the others were ready to
go.</p>

<p>“This place looks as if it had been intentionally
and carefully concealed,” he said; “the hole was
covered with poles and then a layer of dirt over
it. I wonder why? Suppose we investigate a
little. We have plenty of time.”</p>

<p>“Mother says she never expects us back till
night when we go off with you,” laughed Patsy.</p>

<p>“Righto!” said Mr. Osborne. “Dickon, haven’t
you some mining tools hereabouts, a spade and
pick and shovel?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Dick grinned.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll get ready to use them. I’ll show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
you mining methods used by the old Phœnicians
and by the Mexicans to-day. Let’s pile these
poles and logs against the face of the rock.”</p>

<p>The old timbers were piled as Black Mayo directed.
Then he put leaves and twigs under the
dry wood.</p>

<p>“It’s your party, Dick,” he said, when all was
ready. “You may stick a match to the kindling,
and then we’ll flee to the open. We couldn’t
stand the smoke. Besides we’ve work to do out
there.”</p>

<p>As the bonfire flared and roared, they went
scrambling up the ladder.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Black Mayo, “we’ll go to Peter
Jim’s cabin and borrow all his buckets and tubs.
We must fill them with water and have it ready.”</p>

<p>“Ready for what?” inquired Dick.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you presently,” said Black Mayo.</p>

<p>The wondering young folks carried out his
instructions, and then sat around the old mine
from which smoke poured as from a chimney.</p>

<p>All at once Dick again said sharply, “What’s
that?” He looked down the wooded, rocky slope
to the left. “I knew I saw somebody!” he exclaimed,
and ran down the hill.</p>

<p>There was a rustle and stir in a clump of chinquapin
bushes. The foliage parted and a black
face peered out, a man’s frightened, pathetic old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
face. Suddenly a pair of bony black arms were
thrust out wildly from behind, clutched the woolly
head, and dragged it back. There was a violent
struggle, and screeches and sobs and loud, excited
talking.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dick, Dick! Come back!” Patsy screamed
in terror.</p>

<p>For Dick had vanished in the thicket, the
scene of that strange commotion. Mr. Osborne
and David and Steve ran to find him and to see
what was the matter.</p>

<p>Just then Dick reappeared, followed by an old
negro man with a woman tugging at his coat
tails. It was Isham and Lily Belle.</p>

<p>“Come on away!” she was wailing. “Uh,
what you let ’em see you for? My old man, my
old man! Dey got to kill me, too, when dey
kill you.”</p>

<p>“Hush that racket. You’re all right,” said
Dick.</p>

<p>Isham went to Anne and put up appealing
hands. “I didn’t mean you no harm, Miss Anne,”
he sobbed. “I wouldn’t ’a’ teched a hair o’ yore
head.”</p>

<p>“I know you wouldn’t, Unc’ Isham,” said
Anne. “Oh, don’t cry! Do stop crying! Oh!
we’re so glad to see you. We’ve wondered where
you were.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“We runned away,” said Lily Belle. “We—we
started to runned away—an’—an’——”</p>

<p>“Den we crope back,” said Isham. “We done
lived here all our lives, an’ we couldn’t go traipsin’
’round strange neighborhoods. We ruther
you-all would kill us here at home.”</p>

<p>“Nobody’s going to hurt you,” Anne assured
them. “We know you didn’t mean any harm.
Oh, Uncle Isham! Dick and I were hiding in a
hole in the mine, and we heard you telling Cæsar
he mustn’t hurt me. We are all your friends,
and you’re just as safe as we are.”</p>

<p>Lily Belle forgot her fears. “I told you so, old
man,” she cried; “I told you to come on out them
bushes. Ain’t nobody gwine to hurt us. Our
white folks is gwine to take keer of us. Um,
um! Come on home, old man; an’ ain’t we glad
to git back!”</p>

<p>By this time the smoke came in lessening
swirls from the mine hole. Mr. Osborne and the
boys carried the tub into the mine and set it at
the edge of the hole, and filled it with water.</p>

<p>“Now for a smotheration!” he said.</p>

<p>He poured bucketful after bucketful of water
on the hot rock. It filled the air with choking,
blinding steam; and through its hissing came
time after time, like pistol shots, the popping of
the rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>As soon as the steam cleared away a little,
Black Mayo and the boys set to work with pick
and hammer. In a few minutes a large piece
of the split rock was broken off. The gray-green
mass was full of glittering specks and streaks.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, you found it!” said Mr. Osborne,
turning to Dick.</p>

<p>“Found it?” echoed the boys and girls who
were crowding around.</p>

<p>“Found the lost vein of silver. It was true,
then, that tale about the rascally mine manager.
Evidently he concealed this place, hoping to get
possession of the mine and work it. But he died
without being able to carry out his plan. And
now the mine comes back to its rightful owners.”</p>

<p>“Its rightful owners!” stammered Dick. He
had not thought of any right except the right of
discovery. “Rightful owner!” he repeated in
dismay, remembering that this land had been
bought by Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>“Yes; to your father and me, among other
heirs,” said his cousin. “Our grandfather never
lost faith in the mine, and when he sold the land
he reserved the mineral rights. Your tumbling
into this hole was a lucky accident. But for that,
the secret of the old mine’s treasure might have
remained hidden another half century, and you
and I might have died without knowing it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“We surely might.” Dick’s eyes grew grave,
then he turned with a shining face to his young
cousin. “Ah, Anne! that’s a real treasure hole.
Silver isn’t the”—he went closer to her and
dropped his voice—“the dearest thing it’s kept
hidden and safe. But for it—oh! what would
have become of you that awful night?”</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
